When we write  $\displaystyle f'(a)=\lim_{ b \to a } \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$ , we are using the limit notation to define the derivative of the function $f'(a)$.
In this expression:
- $\displaystyle f'(a)$ denotes the derivative of $f$ at $a$
-  $\displaystyle \lim_{ }$ stands for limit
-  $b \to a$ indicates that the variable $b$ approaches the value $a$
-  $\displaystyle \frac{f(a)-f(b)}{b-a}$ represents the average rate of change of the function between $b$ and $a$.
This notation means that the [[Derivative]] of $f$ at $a$ is the value that the difference quotient approaches as $b$ gets closer to $a$ - the [[Slope]] of the [[Tangent]].

The transition from **secant → tangent** is exactly what the **limit definition of the derivative** does:
-  Start with a secant (connecting f(a) and f(b))
- Let b \to a
- The secant line becomes the tangent line — just touches, no longer cuts
