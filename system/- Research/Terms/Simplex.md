A simplicial complex is a structured set composed of simplices, such that all faces and intersections of the elements are also included in the set.  Simplices, or a simplex is a generalisation of a triangle or tetrahedron to any number of dimensions, representing the simplest possible polytope in a given dimension, and used to describe and understand mathematical spaces. Simplices are the fundamental building blocks for constructing higher-dimensional geometric shapes. 
Examples:
0-simplex: A point. 
1-simplex: A line segment. 
2-simplex: A triangle. 
3-simplex: A tetrahedron (a pyramid with a triangular base). 
4-simplex: A pentatope.
