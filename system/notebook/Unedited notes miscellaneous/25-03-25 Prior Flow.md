### 1. Previous Proposition (Prior Flow)
- A previously resolved proposition (a meaning structure) already exists in the Bayesian manifold.
- But before that, _that_ proposition must have originated from a fuzzy resolution—i.e., it began as a synthesis of fibers in the fuzzy space, resolved under constraint, and was then embedded in the probabilistic inference topology.
So this prior proposition is already embedded in the base space—with weight, trajectory, and relevance history encoded.
### 2. New Semantic Encounter
- A new fuzzy field emerges.
- Now, in the fuzzy space, this new field meets the previous proposition, which must now reenter the fuzzy space—not in its probabilistic form, but as a semantic fiber that can combine with the new field.
The prior proposition must be reprojected into the fuzzy space, not as a probability, but as a fiber-like semantic structure—available for recombination under constraint.
### 3. Resolution in Fuzzy Space
- The old fiber (re-entered) and the new fiber (emerging) interact under compatibility rules.
- A new closure is formed—a proposition—that is internally coherent.
- This synthesis supersedes both previous fibers in the fuzzy space.
### 4. Re-embedding in the Base / Bayesian Space
- The newly resolved proposition is then embedded again in the inference geometry.
- It inherits momentum from the base space: directional bias, energetic trace, history of resolution.
- It updates the belief manifold—not by modifying individual probabilities, but by restructuring the topology of inference.

> Recursively imports past propositions into the fuzzy field as semantic participants, then exports newly resolved propositions into the inference field as inferential landmarks.

1. Fuzzy synthesis → Bayesian embedding
2. Reprojection of embedded fiber into fuzzy space
3. New synthesis → new embedding
4. Repeat...

Each cycle adds semantic depth and inferential traction.
