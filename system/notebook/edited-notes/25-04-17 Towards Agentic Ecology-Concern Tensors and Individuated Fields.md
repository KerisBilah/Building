## 25-04-17 Towards Agentic Ecology-Concern Tensors and Individuated Fields

### 1. Concern Tensors and the Origin of Projection

At the heart of agentic ecology is a concern tensorâ€”a structure that encodes the relevance-weighted topology of an agent's possible futures. Unlike semantic fields, which are shared and composed through collective constraint satisfaction, concern tensors are private manifolds, warped by:
- Preference,
- Survival salience,
- Intentional structure,
- And recursive modeling of affordances.

#### 1.1 Concern as Local Curvature

Let the agent's experiential manifold be $\mathcal{M}_a$. Then the concern tensor $C_a$ defines, at each point $x \in \mathcal{M}_a$, a direction-weighted salience field:
$$
C_a(x) = \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial x^i} \right)
$$
where $R$ is a scalar relevance function encoding:
- Proximity to goal states,
- Anticipated reward or penalty,
- Narrative or rhetorical continuity.

This local curvature defines what matters whereâ€”what semantic material will be attracted, resisted, or ignored.

> ðŸ§­ _Concern doesnâ€™t just rank relevanceâ€”it shapes the field through which relevance can be navigated._



#### 1.2 Projection as Self-Instantiation

Agents do not only _feel_ concernâ€”they project themselves into their own tensor. They appear within their own field as:
- Actor (initiator of perturbation),
- Patient (subject to environmental or narrative consequence),
- Observer (modulating salience based on prediction error),
- Strategist (sculpting goal curvature and event topology).

> _The agent is the tensor and the thing in the tensor. It warps, and is warped, by its own concern._

This projection has a formal structure. Let:
- $\mathcal{T}_a$ be the agent's tensorial field,
- $A$ be the agentâ€™s self-model.

Then projection is a mapping:
$$
\pi: A \to \mathcal{T}_a
$$
such that:
- $\pi(A)$ instantiates a curve or path within $\mathcal{T}_a$,
- That path represents a teleological orientationâ€”a cone of affordances projecting from the agentâ€™s current state.

#### 1.3 The Agent-Patient Curve

In agentic ecology, one of the key features is the agentâ€™s capacity to experience itself as patient within its own field. This is not a bugâ€”it is a structural necessity for recursive modeling.

- The agent must encode the anticipated effects of its own actions,
- Simulate resistance, cost, or failure,
- And modulate its projection accordingly.

We model this via a loop:
$$
\lambda: \mathcal{T}_a \rightarrow \mathcal{T}_a
$$
where $\lambda$ encodes the transformation of the field by the agent's projected perturbation.

The fixed points or attractors of $\lambda$ correspond to anticipated consequences that are stable under self-simulationâ€”what the agent "expects" to happen when it acts.

#### 1.4 Agent Individuation and Field Ownership

To individuate is to create a closureâ€”a region of the tensor where:
- Concern is coherent,
- Action is meaningful,
- Modeling is recursively anchored.

This closure, $C \subset \mathcal{T}_a$, is not a boundary in space, but a semantic attractor:
$$
C = \{ x \in \mathcal{T}_a \mid \nabla R(x) \to 0, \quad \text{and} \quad \pi^{-1}(x) \neq \emptyset \}
$$

It is where the agent finds itself "at home" in its own projection.
