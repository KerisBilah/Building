# ⬡PV-E20.x External Observability Protocol (EOP)

## 1. Purpose

The External Observability Protocol (EOP) ensures that engineered systems remain:

- Legible to external auditors and collaborators.
- Epistemically resilient beyond the memory of original contributors.
- Auditably verifiable without invasive internal knowledge.
- Adaptable for future researchers, maintainers, and co-developers.

It defines mandatory *external trace surfaces*, *invariant exposure*, and *semantic degradation signaling*.

| :-------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EOP-1 External Trace Surfaces           | What minimal external traces modules/systems must expose.              |
| EOP-2 External Invariant Checks         | Externalized checks for critical system invariants.                    |
| EOP-3 External Audit Hooks              | Interfaces to enable third-party audit, inspection, or reconstruction. |
| EOP-4 External Visualization Guidelines | Principles for non-intrusive system visualizations.                    |
| EOP-5 Semantic Degradation Signaling    | Protocol for exposing semantic constraint degradation externally.      |

## 3. External Provenance Validation (PV) Codes

| PV Code | Meaning |
|:--------|:--------|
| ⬡PV-E20.1 | External Trace Surfaces defined and exposed. |
| ⬡PV-E20.2 | External Invariant Checks specified and available. |
| ⬡PV-E20.3 | External Audit Hooks declared and maintained. |
| ⬡PV-E20.4 | External Visualization Pipelines defined. |
| ⬡PV-E20.5 | Semantic Degradation Signaling implemented. |

## 4. Section Details

### EOP-1: External Trace Surfaces

Each module/system must define a minimal set of externally observable traces:
- Critical state snapshots (e.g., residuals, activation markers).
- Perturbation response signatures.
- Key diagnostic surfaces reconstructable without internal access.

Traces must be exportable, documented, and non-intrusive.

### EOP-2: External Invariant Checks

Define external scripts or probes that check:
- Critical field structures (e.g., positive-definiteness, closure continuity).
- Perturbation resilience signatures.
- Constraint fidelity markers.

These must be executable by third parties.

### EOP-3: External Audit Hooks

Expose interfaces that allow:
- Sampling of traces.
- Execution of invariant checks.
- Review of AI-generated contributions.

Hooks must be documented and versioned.

### EOP-4: External Visualisation Guidelines

Ensure visualisations:
- Are non-intrusive and reconstructive.
- Use open or common formats (e.g., Graphviz, JSON, SageMath surfaces).
- Expose dynamic behaviours legibly to external observers.

### EOP-5: Semantic Degradation Signaling

On internal degradation (constraint loss, invariant failure), systems must:
- Emit external degradation signals.
- Log and expose minimal traces of degradation sites.
- Continue operating safely or enter fallback modes if needed.

## 5. Integration with Modular Epistemology

EOP forms the outermost layer of epistemic assurance:

| Layer | Role |
|:------|:-----|
| Modular Epistemology | Internal structural integrity. |
| PV System | Internal validation and traceability. |
| EOP | External visibility, trust surfaces, and long-term resilience. |

## 6. Status and Review

This protocol is provisional.  
It will be reviewed when external collaborators, auditors, or third-party users enter the system development ecology.
