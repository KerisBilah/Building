## ⬡ Provenance Theory Validation Header  
### Implementation Note

This PV header supports traceable, modular alignment between lightweight engineering modules and formal architectural invariants.

- Modular Epistemology for Engineering Modules takes precedence. All PV tags are *advisory* unless invoked explicitly (e.g. `@pv_compliance`, `@epistemic_state`, `@invariant_preserved`).
- All PV.x fields are deferable, unless contradiction pressure, structural inference, or design declaration requires them.
- PV tags act as *scaffolds*, not gates — enabling gradual auditability and layered integrity without blocking early or exploratory work.
- The system may auto-infer PV applicability using reflective inference or test structure, but developer judgment governs final declarations.

Use this file to support:
- Reflection on module quality and completeness
- Pedagogical prompts during design, test, or refactor stages
- Gradual alignment with field-level provenance validation

  notes: >
    Aligns provenance validation with Modular Epistemology for Engineering Modules v1.1.
    All PV checks are advisory unless explicitly invoked by engineering module declarations.
    Supports soft integration via @pv_compliance, @epistemic_state, or pedagogical inference.

  PV-E13.x: "Untracked deformation leads to silent projection failure and loss of composable belief flow across modules."
  PV-E14.x: "Failure to track sectional coherence can result in structural contradictions between locally valid but globally incoherent modules."

# ⬡PV Tag Inference, Surfacing, and Design Review

## PV Inference Principles

- PV tags may be inferred from module metadata, structure, and test traces.
- These inferences are non-authoritative and never block development.
- All tags remain editable and deferrable by the engineer.
- PV inference enables reflective tooling and review—not enforcement.

## Design Review Role

Inferred tags are:
- Shown during reflective prompts or code review
- Used to suggest risk areas, epistemic gaps, or pattern analogues
- Subject to engineer override or deletion

## Optional Module Tags for Review

See example snippets below. These are surfaced optionally in module cards, and can be auto-generated or manually written:

[Insert markdown block: "Optional PV Compliance Block for Module Cards"]  
[Insert markdown block: "Closure-PV Tag Crosslink"]  
[Insert markdown block: "Epistemic State and Author Intent"]
