# 1. Introduction: Why This Exists

This document describes how we engineer systems in a way that reflects what we believe to be true, what we want to discover, and how we adapt when we’re wrong.

> Disavowal of Agile and Scrum:
> This system is not Agile, Scrum, or any descendant thereof. It does not use sprints, story points, or managerial roles. It does not track productivity through velocity. Instead, it tracks belief — the formation, refutation, and evolution of structural intention in living code. We reject process theatre and fake autonomy. We work epistemically, not ritually. Engineering here is not sprinting — it’s _meaning making that survives uncertainty_.

## Ethos: The System Respects You

If you're building something hard, you deserve a process that doesn't treat you like a replaceable part.  
The system you’re entering was designed with that in mind.

- It treats morale as a signal — not noise.  
- It tracks how belief forms — and how it fails.  
- It doesn't hide instability. It shows it to you early — so you can act while things are still alive.

## Credibility and Cognitive Cost

We’ve built this around a simple insight:  
Low-morale developers ship low-quality code.

If people feel bored, lost, or cynical, that *shows up in the form*.  
But if the system honours their intelligence — if it shows them where the tension is, where their effort matters — then the code holds together better, too.

This system tracks belief the same way Git tracks changes — because ideas drift, fail, and reform. And we want to know when that’s happening.

> Most systems track what changed.  
> This system doesn’t just track what changed — it tracks _where you were reasoning from_ when you made the change.

That lets us debug not just broken features — but broken thinking.

## Core Commitments

- We reject rigid processes.  
- We adopt loops that allow reality to speak back.  
- We develop iteratively, test-driven, and semantically accountable code.  
- Our engineering process is not about controlling the future.  
  It is about clarifying intention, testing belief, and supporting each other in building systems that stay alive to change.

# What Is This and Why Should You Care?

You're about to work inside a system that helps teams ship real, hard things — without burning out or getting stuck in endless refactors.

This doc gives you the basics of how we design software here. It’s not “best practices.” It’s a way of thinking that actually scales, even when the system is messy, unfinished, or full of unknowns.

Here’s the deal:
- You test first, because tests are how we say what we believe.
- You build only what you need to pass the test — no fantasy features.
- Then, you refactor — not just to clean up, but to keep future changes possible.

These three phases — Red, Green, Blue — are our main loop.

The loop looks like this:
- Red = write a failing test that says what should be true
- Green = write the minimum code to make it pass
- Blue = make the code better without changing what it does, so it’s easier to extend next time

In Blue, you reshape the code so new ideas aren’t boxed out. You spot constraints and fold them into the form. You keep the future open.

There’s a second loop too — a safety layer. The system watches for patterns (like sketchy indexing, mutation in the wrong place, or missing checks) and suggests tests or flags risks. You can accept, defer, or override — but you can’t ignore it. That’s how we avoid dumb mistakes while keeping our focus on the real design.

Every time you build something, you declare:

- What it’s for (`@why`)
- What state it’s in (`@closure`)
- What proves it works (`@test`)
- What its limits are (`@known_limits`)

That’s it. Short, honest, readable. Like a journal entry for your code.

You don’t have to solve the whole system. You just need to be clear about what you’re trying to do — and make that clarity visible to others.

This system isn’t about following rules. It’s about making smart things *survivable*.  
You can go fast. You can try wild stuff. But when things break, we know where and why.

So yeah — this isn’t school. It’s not a style guide.  
It’s a way to make thinking show up in code, and to treat each other’s work with trust.

If you’re building something real, this helps it stay real.

Let’s go.

# 2. Core Loops

We develop using two interwoven loops: intention by declaration and intention by action.

## 2.1 Red–Green–Blue (RGB) — The Intention Loop

This is a design methodology:
- Red: Write a test expressing what you want to be true. It fails.
- Green: Write the minimal code that makes the test pass.
- Blue: Design — reshape form so that _future intention remains expressible_.
- The current form may satisfy the test, but inhibit further development, composability, or articulation.
- Refactor the code in response to emerging semantic or structural constraints.    
- Blue is where new constraints are acknowledged and local form adapts to remain viable under them.
- This is the phase of propagated constraint — where form bends to sustain global continuity and evolving intention.

This loop ensures that intention expressed as a test — unconstrained in form but bounded in truth — becomes intention realised through the minimal structure that satisfies it.

## 2.2 Structural Recognition & Verification Loop (SRVL) — The Hygiene Loop

- When you use certain structures (e.g. `match`, `Option`, indexing), the system classifies your code and suggests known risk tests.
- These tests are run or deferred. You must acknowledge them before submission.
- They don’t test your intention—they test for common failure modes.

# 2.3 Design Initiation Protocol — @design_initiation_check

Before you begin building a module, you must pass a lightweight scoping check.  
This is a micro-epistemology for module formation: a test of readiness and alignment.  
It helps avoid overreach, collapse-inducing scope, or ungrounded belief commitments.

It consists of 6 questions. They may be answered by a human or LLM.

Each question ties directly to PV-tagged architectural principles.  
A module is considered `@initiation:passed` when all six are affirmed or scoped down.

## 2.3.1 Design Initiation Questions

| Question | Purpose | PV Link |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Q1. Is this module anchored in a motivating contradiction, deformation, or tension? | Ensures you're building in response to irreducible pressure. | ⬡[PV1.2], ⬡[PV2.2] |
| Q2. Does it operate within a bounded region of concern? | Prevents unconstrained or system-wide scope. | ⬡[PV2.1] |
| Q3. Can a partial closure be scoped and scaffolded? | Encourages provisional development and avoids collapse pressure. | ⬡[PV3.7], ⬡[PV3.8] |
| Q4. Is there a functorial trace or projection dependency? | Connects this module to the architecture's belief flow. | ⬡[PV1.3], ⬡[PV2.3] |
| Q5. Does this module preserve or explicitly modulate semantic structure? | Tests whether you respect rhetorical or field integrity. | ⬡[PV3.1], ⬡[PV3.4] |
| Q6. Is this the smallest viable kernel that can be built and tested now? | Prevents planning collapse due to entangled scope–time uncertainty. | ⬡[PV-E11.2], ⬡[PV2.2] |

> You may answer `no`, but then you must explicitly defer or restructure scope.  
> Declare: `@initiation:deferred` and log the reason in the module card.

# 3. Working with Closure

### Engineering Closure (`@closure:provisional`, etc.)

The word “closure” is doing epistemic double-duty in the system. It appears both:

- Formally, in the semantic architecture — as the _collapse of tension into belief_, governed by ⬡PV2.2; and
- Practically, in the engineering loop — as the _satisfaction of intention through code_, tagged via `@closure`.

The alignment is not accidental, “closure” in both cases indicates:

> A locally valid commitment, derived from irreducible tension, that supports further structure.

The engineering loop is _instantiating_ this epistemic reflexivity. We're building a systems that reflect semantic closure, by building them through semantic closure.

The terms are analogous only in metaphor, not in structure.

#### Term Disambiguation: “Closure”  
Closure is a developmental state — indicating that a module has reached a _stable enough_ expression of its intended functionality, supported by tests or usage.

Key properties:
- Intention-defined
- Provisional or revisable
- Grounded in TDD or human judgment
- Explicitly declared via `@closure` tags

> In this document, `@closure:` refers to engineering stability — a module’s declared and tested operational state.  
> In the theoretical architecture (see ⬡PV2.2), _closure_ means semantic collapse: a projection event from the manifold 𝓕 into belief space 𝓑 triggered by irreducible tension.  

## 3.1 Closure Status Tags

- `@closure:open` — still exploratory
- `@closure:provisional` — passes intention test, used by others
- `@closure:refuted` — test failed or contradicted by implementation
- `@closure:enabled` — designed to support testing or connection, not belief

## 3.2 Declaring Closure

You don’t have to be certain. You only have to declare what you think this code achieves:

> `@why: This module enables downstream modulation checks.`  
> `@closure:enabled`

# 4. Documentation as Light-Touch Guidance

Every module should have a minimal card, written in markdown, tagged and indexed.

## Required Fields

- `@why:` — What is this for?
- `@closure:` — What state is this in?
- `@test:` — What proves it?
- `@refuted:` — If known contradictions exist
- `@known_limits:` — Optional, but helpful

Keep it short. Link to test files or theory notes as needed.

## 4.1 Module Card Template (Extended)

Every module should have a minimal, human-readable metadata card.  
This card grounds intention, declares closure state, and links to tests.

### Required Fields

- `@why:` — What is this for?
- `@closure:` — What state is this in? (`open`, `provisional`, `refuted`, `enabled`)
- `@test:` — What proves it?
- `@design_initiation_check:` — `passed` / `deferred` / `bypassed` (only with rationale)
- `@refuted:` — If known contradictions exist
- `@known_limits:` — Optional, but helpful

### Optional Support Fields

- `@initiation_log:` — Notes on scope evolution or design shifts  
- `@morale_delta:` — `low`, `high`, or `stressed`  
- `@cognitive_cost:` — `low`, `moderate`, or `high`  
- `@blue_guidance:` — Refactoring rationale and projection support fields (see §13)


> These fields are meant to support architectural epistemics — not bureaucratic overhead.  
> They allow us to treat engineering decisions as belief structures with scope, trace, and update paths.

# 5. Testing: Two Layers

## 5.1 Intention Tests (RGB)

- You write these by hand.
- They express what the system should do if your belief is true.
- These tests define closure.

## 5.2 Routine Error Tests (SRVL)

- Auto-suggested based on code structure.
- Check for things like:
  - off-by-one
  - option unwrapping
  - non-exhaustive matches
  - mutation in pure context

If these fail: fix, or tag with `@ack:deferred` and submit with care.

# 6. Submission Ritual

Before submitting, ensure the following:

- RGB loop is green or blue.
- SRVL has been acknowledged or passed.
- You’ve written (minimally):
  - `@why`
  - `@closure`
  - `@test:` or link

Optional:
- `@known_limits`
- `@morale_delta`

Submission is a belief gesture. Keep it honest. Keep it light.

# 7. Pedagogical Support Layer

We don’t believe in reinventing the wheel.  
When you use well-known structures (e.g. tensors, fields, closures, projections), the system recognises them and points to helpful references.

#### What This Is  
You don’t have to memorise the theory. The system notices what you’re working with — like tensors, projections, or closures — and surfaces helpful prompts, but it's optional!!

#### Why It’s Cool  
It’s like autocomplete for structure and meaning. You learn by building. The system quietly offers help when it sees something familiar.

#### How You Use It  
Add tags like `@field`, `@functor`, or `@tensor` to your code. When a match happens, you’ll get helpful guidance, examples, or prior art. Ignore it or use it — it’s there when you need it.

# 7. Pedagogical Support Layer

## 7.1 Structural Tags

Use tags like:
- `@tensor`, `@field`, `@functor`, `@distribution`, `@topology`

These trigger the pedagogical surface.

## 7.2 Support Prompts

If you're working with a tensor field, you may see:

> “This resembles ⬡PV1.1 (Relevance Fields).  
> Similar structures appear in:  
> – TensorFlow field mapping  
> – Noetherian forms in dynamical systems  
> – Semantic Manifold Collapse in Projection Systems”

You are free to ignore these. But they’re there so you don’t have to figure it all out alone.

# 8. Reflective Recognition Layer

The system continuously reads your code for structural resemblance.

#### What This Is  
This layer watches your code and recognises patterns — like “this looks like a projection” or “this might be a new structure.”

#### Why It’s Cool  
You don’t need to remember every previous module. If your design matches something, it lets you know. If it’s new, you can tag it as original.

#### How You Use It  
Just write code. If the system sees something useful — or something weird — it surfaces that. You can tag with `@novel_structure` or follow a suggested design thread. It helps the system learn from *you* too.

# 8. Reflective Recognition Layer (AI Support)

## 8.1 Pattern Recognition

- If your implementation resembles a known structure, you'll be notified.
- The system will offer:
  - Historical analogues
  - Canonical theory uses
  - Similar prior modules

> “This projection module resembles ⬡PV1.3 in structure and naming.  
> Would you like to review its closure strategy?”

## 8.2 Uniqueness Detection

When the system finds no match, it says:

> “No structural analogue found in the current system.  
> Consider tagging this as a possible innovation: `@novel_structure`.”

This isn't surveillance. It's contextual mentorship.  
You can ignore, defer, or engage.

## 8.3 PV Trace Inference Schema

The system automatically infers trace metadata to preserve semantic lineage without burdening the engineer. This replaces earlier `@pv_inferred` terminology with a more accurate designation: `@pv_trace`.

These tags:
- Are auto-attached by the system upon module creation or update.
- May be reviewed, edited, elevated to `@pv_compliance`, or ignored.
- Do not block submission or testing.
- Enable architecture-wide reflection, pedagogy, and closure analysis.

### PV Trace Block (auto-inferred, editable)

@pv_trace:
  - PV-E0.1: "Declared @why + passed initiation Q1"
  - PV-E2.x: "Test file linked via @test"
  - PV-E5.x: "@refuted or @known_limits declared"
  - PV-E7.x: "Structure tagged with @functor / @invariant_preserved"
  - PV-E11.x: "Module shows AI reflection / semantic drift handling"

→ These may be promoted to `@pv_compliance:` or pruned during review.

### Declaring Review State

Optionally, modules may declare their epistemic state and compliance level:

@pv_level: scoped  
@epistemic_state: exploratory  
@authorship_mode: full_manual  
@invariant_preserved: [field_topology, projection_coherence]

These fields help reviewers understand maturity, intention, and semantic stakes.

### Review Use Only

This system exists to support honest reflection, not compliance pressure.  
Design reviews may surface inferred tags for discussion — not for enforcement.  
Your module is yours.

→ See also: Appendix – Engineering Provenance Validation v1.1 § PV Tag Inference

## 8.4 Review Metadata Defaults

Review metadata supports interpretation of a module's epistemic status. These fields are optional to declare, but default-inferred if not specified.

@pv_level: unscoped   # inferred if undeclared
@epistemic_state: unclassified   # inferred from module history
@authorship_mode: inferred_manual   # may be 'ai_assisted' or 'collaborative'
@invariant_preserved: [ ]   # inferred from structure tags if missing

→ These guide reflection, not enforcement. Editable at any point.


# 9. Narrative and Epistemic Tracking

We care about how belief evolves. Not just how code changes.

#### What This Is  
It’s like Git for belief. Instead of just tracking code changes, you log why a module was built, refactored, or abandoned.

#### Why It’s Cool  
When something breaks later, you can trace intention — not just implementation. It’s version control for thinking.

#### How You Use It  
Add `@intention_log` notes when the purpose or structure of a module shifts. Optionally include morale tags like `@morale_delta: low`. It’s not for management — it’s to help you and your teammates stay in sync.

# 9. Narrative and Epistemic Tracking


## 9.1 Intention Log

Each module may include a short, growing `@intention_log` like:

- `2025-05-01`: Began as contradiction resolver for ⬡PV1.2
- `2025-05-03`: Failed under curvature drift; closed branch T42
- `2025-05-06`: Refactored for projection under modulation

This tells the story of the module’s epistemic life.

## 9.2 Morale and Cognitive Cost Tracing

These tags track design difficulty, decision fatigue, and cognitive overhead. They are always optional, but the system may prompt their use under conditions of repeated reopening, tag drift, or high inferred entropy.

@morale_delta: low   # Suggested if module reopened multiple times
@cognitive_cost: high   # Inferred from complexity or support requests

→ These assist team coordination and identify where engineering closure is struggling.

# 10. Drift Monitoring and Systemic Closure

We don't just track modules—we track the *architecture's epistemic state*.

#### What This Is  
It tracks the health of belief across the whole system. Not just whether tests pass — but whether the system is *holding together conceptually*.

#### Why It’s Cool  
Sometimes, things feel fine because no one’s looking. This layer watches for drift — not as punishment, but as signal. It surfaces silent instability before it becomes collapse.

If six modules are refuted and drift is accelerating, that’s not shame.  
It’s a flare in the dark: *belief is losing traction — pay attention here*.

#### How You Use It  
You don’t. It runs in the background. But when it speaks, listen.  
This is the architecture telling you where thinking is failing to stabilise.  
It’s not just about the code. It’s about *where your attention is needed most*.

Morale matters too — because systems that feel pointless often are.  
If developers are disengaged, the system can’t cohere. This layer helps keep it alive — by keeping it interesting, alert, and responsive.

#### What This Is  
It tracks the system-wide state of closure. How much is stable? What’s open, fragile, or falling apart? It’s a dashboard for belief health.

#### Why It’s Cool  
You don’t just see “tests passed.” You see whether the *architecture itself* is holding together — or drifting apart.

#### How You Use It  
You don’t need to do anything. But the system might tell you:  
“You have 6 refuted modules and drift is accelerating.”  
It’s not blame — it’s visibility.

# 10. Drift Monitoring and Systemic Closure

## 10.1 Closure Topology

The system periodically aggregates:

- Open modules
- Provisional closures
- Refuted branches
- Unacknowledged risk areas

This produces a closure convergence score  
→ Are we stabilising belief, or generating contradictions faster than we resolve them?

## 10.2 What You See

You might see:

> “You have 37 open modules, 21 provisionally closed, 6 refuted.  
> Closure convergence rate has declined in past 5 days.”

This isn’t to pressure you—it’s to help us know where we are in our development ecology.

## 10.3 Epistemic Reflex Loop — Projection, Contradiction, and Reflection

This formal loop underpins the architecture’s ability to learn structurally by coordinating feedback between theory and engineering. When a theoretical claim fails in practice, or an engineering shape resists projection, this loop encodes and responds.

> For full canonical specification, see:  
> *Epistemic Reflex Loop — Coordinating Projection, Contradiction, and Reflection v1.0*

Key concepts include:
- `Projection`: theory enters testable code
- `Contradiction`: the engineered form resists or refutes theory
- `Reflection`: system learns, revises, or prunes based on feedback

Modules may be tagged with:

- `@reflex_event:` if a contradiction has been logged
- `@reflex_log:` optional field for commentary or links
- `@pv_trace:` block auto-infers loop participation

→ Reflex data is visible in Kanban overlays, Tranche sync status, and closure convergence metrics.

Non-participation in the loop does not block module flow — but reflex silence increases epistemic opacity for teams downstream.  
We trust engineers to declare meaningfully when it matters.

See also: §15 Tranche-Based Closure Coordination


# 11. Complementarity of Scope and Time

Planning is difficult because scope and time are epistemically entangled.

#### What This Is  
It explains why planning always breaks down if you try to fix scope *and* time at the same time. It’s not a management flaw — it’s a built-in epistemic limit.

#### Why It’s Cool  
It gives you permission to stop pretending you can estimate the future *perfectly*. Instead, it gives you tools for real, adaptive decision-making. It's honest engineering.

#### How You Use It  
When starting something new, fix your timebox — let scope unfold.  
When shipping, fix the feature — let the time flex.  
Declare which one you're constraining. Don't lie to yourself.  
This is a better way to be *wrong safely*.

## 11.1 Complementarity Principle

> The more precisely you try to fix *what* must be done (scope),  
> the less reliably you can say *when* it will be done (time)—and vice versa.

Trying to fix both at once often leads to breakdown, contradiction, or illusion.

## 11.2 Uncertainty Relation

We model this as:

$$
\sigma_{scope} \cdot \sigma_{time} \geq \theta_{engineering}
$$

Where:
- $\sigma_{scope}$ = uncertainty in what must be delivered
- $\sigma_{time}$ = uncertainty in when it can be delivered
- $\theta_{engineering}$ = irreducible epistemic friction in the system

You may constrain time (e.g. “We stop Friday”) or scope (e.g. “We ship feature X”)  
→ but never both without superstition.

## 11.3 Practical Implications

- When starting something new: fix time, explore scope.  
- When finishing something tested: fix scope, let time stretch.  
- At scale: document which is being constrained per module or milestone.

Declare it. Don’t pretend you can know both.

# 12. Epistemic Kanban Configuration

This Kanban configuration supports the semantic development lifecycle.  
Each card represents a belief trace, closure attempt, or epistemic gesture.

#### What This Is  
Your Kanban board isn’t just task tracking. It’s a belief map.  
Each card isn’t “do this” — it’s “here’s what we think is true, and what we’re trying to prove.”

#### Why It’s Cool  
It turns your development board into an epistemic system.  
You see which ideas are stable, which are collapsing, and which ones are just sketches.  
The board becomes a semantic field, not just a backlog.

#### How You Use It  
Every card has a `@why`, `@closure`, and `@test`.  
Colour and tag signals track morale, contradiction, novelty, and refactors.  
The system helps you *see where belief lives — and where it’s in danger*.

## Columns: Epistemic Lifecycle

### Intention Declared
A `@why` has been written. The module or function exists as a statement of intent. No tests written.

### Test Written (Red)
A failing test expresses intention. `@closure:open`. The Red phase of the RGB loop.

### Code Passes (Green)
Minimal code has been written to satisfy the test. Module enters provisional closure.

### Refactored (Blue)
The code has been restructured for generality, clarity, and expression. Ready for SRVL and documentation.

### SRVL Running
Structural Recognition & Verification Loop is triggered based on patterns. Routine error suite is executing or awaiting `@ack:deferred`.

### Submitted / Awaiting Review
All loops passed or acknowledged. Module submitted with belief and closure declarations.

### Closure Achieved
`@closure:provisional` or `@closure:enabled` declared. Module actively supports downstream work.

### Refuted or Reopened
Previously closed module reopened due to contradiction, test failure, or drift. `@closure:refuted` applied.

## Card Template

Each card should minimally include:
- `@why:` A short intention or outcome declaration
- `@closure:` One of `open`, `provisional`, `enabled`, `refuted`
- `@test:` Reference to associated test
- `@known_limits:` Optional, for known gaps or assumptions
- `@morale_delta:` Optional, for cognitive cost or satisfaction

Title: Use a concise capability or belief description  
Link: Module, PR, or documentation entry

## Swim-Lane Inference Layer

Modules are placed into architectural swim-lanes based on inferred PV tags or structural resemblance. Engineers may override at any time.

Auto-assignment examples:
- ⬡PV1.1–1.2 → Field Tensors
- ⬡PV1.3–1.5 → Projection Stack
- ⬡PV3.4, ⬡PV3.5 → Recognition Layer / SRVL
- ⬡PV5.x → Infrastructure & Tooling
- No match → Unsorted / Novel Structures

@swim_lane: projection_stack   # inferred


## Tag Conventions (Search & Filter)

- `@why:` → Epistemic purpose
- `@closure:` → Module status
- `@refuted:` → Contradicted or retracted projection
- `@enabler` → Module exists to support interaction, not belief
- `@novel_structure` → Unrecognized or original form
- `@ack:deferred` → Routine test acknowledged but not resolved
- `@morale_delta:` → morale impact (`low`, `high`, `critical`)
- `@intention_log:` → tracked epistemic changes (optional)

## Visualisation Notes

- Red border → still in Red (failing test)
- Green highlight → test passes, awaiting refactor
- Blue glow → undergoing SRVL
- Gray dashed → tagged with `@morale_delta:low`
- Gold pin → flagged `@novel_structure`

## Meta-Principle

> A Kanban board is not just a task manager.  
> It is a semantic field map of what we believe, what we’re testing, and where contradiction lives.

# 13. Blue Phase Design Guidance — `@blue_guidance`

The Blue phase is where structure adapts to remain open to future intention.  
The `@blue_guidance` block allows engineers to declare how this adaptation has occurred, what constraints shaped it, and how projection structure has been preserved or changed.

This metadata supports:
- Epistemic traceability
- Future refactoring clarity
- Design analogue detection
- Reflective prompts in the development UI

#### What This Is  
When you refactor during the Blue phase, you’re not just cleaning up —  
you’re reshaping the system to stay open to future intention.  
This block captures *why you made the change*, *what constraints you noticed*, and *how stable the form now is*.

#### Why It’s Cool  
Most codebases forget why things were shaped a certain way.  
This lets you preserve structural memory.  
It also lets the system trace where projection, curvature, and failure risks are rising.

#### How You Use It  
Fill in the `@blue_guidance` block when refactoring:
- What future use did this unlock?
- What constraint or fragility did you see?
- Did you improve stability, or just shift risk?

This lets your team and future-you see the *logic of the form*.

## 13.1 Fields of @blue_guidance

@blue_guidance:
  - projected_intention: [future capability enabled]
  - constraint_detected: [semantic|structural|curvature|rhetorical]
  - functorial_trace_preserved: true|false|partial
  - curvature_delta: low|medium|high
  - reprojection_viability: fragile|same|improved
  - pv_link: [optional theory PV tag embodied, e.g. PV3.4]
  - structural_analogy: [module or PV reference]
  - morphism_stack_updated: yes|no|n/a


You may include all, or only the ones relevant to the change.  
This is a reflective declaration, not a required format.

## 13.2 Example

@blue_guidance:
  - projected_intention: composable projection check for downstream modules
  - constraint_detected: structure overfit, test coupling
  - functorial_trace_preserved: partially
  - curvature_delta: medium
  - reprojection_viability: improved
  - structural_analogy: ⬡PV3.5 modulation-wrapper
  - morphism_stack_updated: yes

## 13.3 When to Use

Add this when:
- You are in the Blue phase of the RGB loop.
- A refactor is done for future expressiveness.
- You want to track structural or rhetorical implications.

## 13.4 Review Surface

This block may be surfaced during peer review to:
- Understand the design shift
- Compare it to prior modules
- Assess reprojection health and curvature complexity

# 14. Epistemic Scheduling & Tension Dashboard

The system maintains real-time awareness of closure pressure across architectural regions using swim-lane tension scoring.  
This supports adaptive design attention and equitable epistemic maintenance.

#### What This Is  
The system tracks which parts of the architecture are under tension — where closures are failing, projections are drifting, or morale is low.  
It’s an epistemic load balancer.

#### Why It’s Cool  
Most teams over-focus on local problems and miss systemic ones.  
This dashboard tells you: *“This region of the system is stressed. Work here.”*

And it doesn’t just guess. It reads your real tags:  
`@closure:refuted`, `@blue_guidance`, `@morale_delta`, `@curvature_delta`, and more.

#### How You Use It  
You’ll see surfaced suggestions:
> "Next swim lane: Recognition Layer.  
> Drift pressure rising. 2 fragile modules need review."

You don’t *have* to follow it. But if you ignore it too long, the system tells the truth anyway:  
“Your closure convergence rate is collapsing.”

This helps us move where thinking is stuck — not just where code is broken.

## 14.1 Closure–Tension Scoring Function

Each swim lane is assigned a dynamic Lane Tension Score:

lane_tension =  
  $w₁ \cdot C_{\text{open}}$ +  
  $w₂ \cdot C_{\text{refuted}}$ +  
  $w₃ \cdot C_{\text{high\_curvature}}$ +  
  $w₄ \cdot C_{\text{fragile\_reprojection}}$ +  
  $w₅ \cdot C_{\text{attention\_starved}}$ −  
  $w₆ \cdot C_{\text{provisional}}$

Where:
- $C_*$ terms are counts of modules by state or tag (`@closure`, `@blue_guidance`, etc.)
- $w₁$–$w₆$ are tunable weights, declared in config or code

This reflects epistemic pressure, semantic instability, or under-attended regions.

## 14.2 Round-Robin Lane Scheduler

A simple adaptive scheduler rotates engineering focus across swim lanes, weighted by their tension.  
Each cycle (e.g., daily, weekly), the next swim lane is surfaced with priority:

> Next swim lane to address: `recognition_layer`  
> Top tension signals: `M17` high-curvature refactor, `T12` drifted projection

This prevents epistemic stagnation in semantically loaded but neglected regions.

## 14.3 Visualisation and Surface

Lane-level summaries are overlaid in Kanban and dashboards:

| Swim Lane         | Tension Score | Suggested Focus |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Projection Stack | 0.91 🔥        | Refactor T42, review C23 |
| Recognition Layer| 0.68 ⚠️         | Stabilise M11 |
| Field Tensors     | 0.34 🟢        | Optional attention |

Modules contributing to high tension may be tagged:
- `@closure:refuted`
- `@blue_guidance` with `reprojection_viability: fragile` or `curvature_delta: high`
- `@morale_delta: low`

## 14.4 Closure Convergence Integration

This mechanism interacts directly with closure monitoring in §10.

- High lane tension suppresses architecture-wide convergence rate
- Round-robin scheduling restores coverage and closure potential
- Used to estimate $\frac{d}{dt} \text{(closure stability)}$ over active modules

See also:
- §10 *Drift Monitoring and Systemic Closure*
- §13 *Blue Phase Design Guidance — `@blue_guidance`*

# 15. Tranche-Based Closure Coordination

Modules may now declare membership in a cross-sectional epistemic tranche — a provisional grouping of modules intended to converge together.

A `@tranche` is not a timeline or milestone — it’s a coherence hypothesis:  
> “These modules, when synchronised, instantiate a coherent belief state or capability.”

## 15.1 Tranche Purpose

Tranches enable:
- Synchronous convergence tracking across lanes
- Coordinated round-robin scheduling for closure alignment
- Detection of constraint-induced lag (Goldratt’s “Cub Scout” effect)

## 15.2 Tranche Metadata Block

Each tranche is declared via the following structure:

@tranche:
  tranche_id: T23_projection_sync
  tranche_goal: "Enable composable projection stack with curvature modulation"
  tranche_members: [proj_kernel_01, mod_curve_recalc, wrap_env_bridge]
  tranche_constraint: mod_curve_recalc
  tranche_sync_status: 66% closed
  tranche_rhythm_link: enabled

This block is added to each module card that participates.  
You may also define a tranche object in your design environment to track centrally.

## 15.3 Closure Integration

The system automatically surfaces:
- Sync status (% of modules with `@closure:provisional` or better)
- Blocking constraints (inferred from `@blue_guidance` or test drift)
- Suggested lane attention if `@tranche_rhythm_link: enabled`

This gives teams a live view of cross-sectional coherence pressure.

## 15.4 Round-Robin Extension

When `@tranche_rhythm_link` is enabled:
- The round-robin scheduler incorporates tranche sync state into attention rotation
- Lanes supporting under-closed tranches are surfaced earlier
- Constraint-bearing modules are highlighted as sync enablers

This extends round-robin beyond lane fairness — it becomes a belief synchroniser.

## 15.5 Visual Surface

Tranche states may be visualised alongside lane dashboards:

| Tranche ID     | Sync % | Blocking Module | Sync Goal              |
|----------------|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| T23_projection | 66%    | mod_curve_recalc | composable projection   |
| T11_inference  | 100%   | —                | diagnostic handshake    |
| T07_drift_fix  | 42%    | drift_trace_A42  | closure reconvergence   |

Tranches may trigger alerts if sync decays, or if belief fails to stabilise after a sync attempt.

> Use `@tranche:` to track not just what we believe,  
> but which sets of beliefs are meant to align — and when they don’t.


# Appendix – Engineering Provenance Validation v1.1

⬡[PV-Engineering-Header]
## Implementation Note

This PV header supports traceable, modular alignment between lightweight engineering modules and formal architectural invariants.

- Modular Epistemology for Engineering Modules takes precedence. All PV tags are *advisory* unless invoked explicitly (e.g. `@pv_compliance`, `@epistemic_state`, `@invariant_preserved`).
- All PV.x fields are deferable, unless contradiction pressure, structural inference, or design declaration requires them.
- PV tags act as *scaffolds*, not gates — enabling gradual auditability and layered integrity without blocking early or exploratory work.
- The system may auto-infer PV applicability using reflective inference or test structure, but developer judgment governs final declarations.

Use this file to support:
- Reflection on module quality and completeness
- Pedagogical prompts during design, test, or refactor stages
- Gradual alignment with field-level provenance validation

# ⬡PV Tag Inference, Surfacing, and Design Review

## PV Inference Principles

- PV tags may be inferred from module metadata, structure, and test traces.
- These inferences are non-authoritative and never block development.
- All tags remain editable and deferrable by the engineer.
- PV inference enables reflective tooling and review—not enforcement.

## Design Review Role

Inferred tags are:
- Shown during reflective prompts or code review
- Used to suggest risk areas, epistemic gaps, or pattern analogues
- Subject to engineer override or deletion

## Optional Module Tags for Review

See example snippets below. These are surfaced optionally in module cards, and can be auto-generated or manually written:

[Insert markdown block: "Optional PV Compliance Block for Module Cards"]  
[Insert markdown block: "Closure-PV Tag Crosslink"]  
[Insert markdown block: "Epistemic State and Author Intent"]
