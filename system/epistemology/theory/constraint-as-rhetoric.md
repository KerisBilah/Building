## 1 Structural Template Conformance

### 1.1 Motivating Intuition
⬡[PV0.1]

For centuries, logic was pictured as a flow—from universal truths down to particular instances—structured by diagrams like the Square of Opposition. But even early thinkers like Ockham suspected that this flow was less a law of nature than a rhetorical habit: a compression of language, shaped more by pressure than necessity.

What if meaning does not cascade downward, but strains against itself? What if belief emerges not from inheritance, but from collapse—when tensions in meaning become irreconcilable? Seen this way, constraint is not a limit on thought, but a generator of structure.

We follow that intuition reimagining interpretation not as inference through symbols, but as resolution across a semantic field: a topology of pressures, contradictions, and emergent closures. Belief, in this architecture, is not selected—it is forced by tension, guided by rhetorical strategies that shape the flow of resolution. Constraint becomes rhetoric, and resolution becomes geometry.

This paper proposes a formal account of how constraint resolution, modulated by rhetorical priors, gives rise to expressive belief formation in tensorial semantic systems.

### 1.2 Implicit Questions
⬡[PV1.x] ⬡[PV2.x]

| Question                                                                   | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                   | Linked PV          |

| Q1. How do rhetorical priors bias collapse?                                | They modulate the resolution path without altering the field structure.                                                                                          | ⬡[PV3.1]           |
| Q2. What makes a constraint expressive rather than merely limiting?        | Expression emerges when collapse preserves or enacts a rhetorical disposition.                                                                                   | ⬡[PV3.3], ⬡[PV2.2] |
| Q3. How is contradiction treated geometrically?                            | It appears as field deformation; its resolution defines semantic topologies.                                                                                     | ⬡[PV1.2], ⬡[PV2.2] |
| Q4. What determines whether tension leads to belief?                       | Closure is not automatic; it’s threshold-driven and bias-shaped.                                                                                                 | ⬡[PV2.2], ⬡[PV3.1] |
| Q5. What roles do traversal and preparation play before belief projection? | Resolution is preceded by semantic shaping — non-destructive, reversible transformations.                                                                        | ⬡[PV2.1], ⬡[PV1.1] |
| Q6. Can conceptual structure shape how a belief forms?                     | Morphisms based on conceptual geometry modulate the collapse path.                                                                                               | ⬡[PV3.1], ⬡[PV3.3] |
| Q7. What happens when a system cannot assimilate contradiction?            | Surprise metrics may instantiate pseudo-agents or deferred commitments.                                                                                          | ⬡[PV3.4]           |
| Q8. How does the architecture detect agency?                               | Persistent contradiction and anchoring mass trigger recognition in $\mathcal{F}$.                                                                                | ⬡[PV3.4], ⬡[PV4.1] |
| Q9. How are beliefs situated in discourse?                                 | Projection is triadic, encoding emitter, addressee, and referent.                                                                                                | ⬡[PV4.2]           |

| Q12. Can beliefs reshape the semantic field?                               | Because projection is functorial and reversible ⬡[PV1.4], commitments feed back into the topology of meaning — enabling rhetorical learning and reconfiguration. | ⬡[PV1.4]           |

### 1.3 Formal Structure
⬡[PV3.1]

Core objects

1. Rhetorical prior  
   $\pi_i:(\mathcal F,\mathcal C)\to\delta\mathcal C$ (biases constraint flow)

2. Constraint Morphism Stack (CMS)  
   $\text{CMS}=\pi_n\circ\cdots\circ\pi_1$ — composable, order-sensitive.

3. Traversal Layer $\text{TRL}_{\!inf}$  
   Reversible search over $\mathcal{F}$; never projects to $\mathcal B$.

4. UCSE pointer  
   *Unified Constraint Satisfaction Engine* acts as an internal tensor-sculptor; implementation lives in UCSE-notes, not here.

> Formal invariant ⬡[PV3.2]  
> Each $\pi_i$ must preserve the narrative trace $\tau$ while bending resolution.

### 1.3.1 Emergent Anchoring and Composite Agents

#### Metaphysical Anchoring Operator
⬡[PV1.6]

We define a local anchoring mass operator over the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$:

$$
\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}} : \mathcal{F} \;\longrightarrow\; [0,1]
$$

For each point $x\in\mathcal{F}$, the anchoring mass is:

$$
\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}(x) = \sigma\left( \|\nabla_t R(x)\| - \lambda \|\mathcal{C}(\Xi)(x)\| \right)
$$

where:

- $\nabla_t R(x)$: expected future deformation of concern field $R$ at $x$,
- $\mathcal{C}(\Xi)(x)$: projection of contradiction tensor $\Xi$ onto belief space,
- $\lambda$: tunable capture-weight parameter,
- $\sigma$: logistic squashing function to $[0,1]$.

Interpretation:  
- High $\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}(x)$ indicates a still-surprising, irreducible source.
- Low $\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}(x)$ indicates projected, absorbed behavior.

Anchoring mass quantifies metaphysical "resistance" to full projection collapse.

#### Agent Blanket Constructor
⬡[PV1.7]

Given a set of projected agents $\{\hat{\mathcal{A}}_i\}$ and their anchoring mass maps $\{\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(i)}\}$,  
we define the Agent Blanket Constructor $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{sup}}$ as:

$$
\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{sup}} = \left\{ x \in \mathcal{F} \;\middle|\; \chi_{ij}(x) > \tau_\chi \;\text{for some}\; i,j \right\}
$$

where the anchoring compatibility ratio $\chi_{ij}(x)$ is:

$$
\chi_{ij}(x) = \frac{ \min\left( \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(i)}(x), \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(j)}(x) \right) }{ \max\left( \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(i)}(x), \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(j)}(x) \right) }
$$

and $\tau_\chi$ is a threshold for sufficient anchoring compatibility.

Interpretation:  
When two projected agents overlap in $\mathcal{F}$ with sufficiently matched anchoring mass, they can form a composite agentic region —  
preserving their core irreducibility while coordinating field deformation under a shared envelope.

### 1.5 Background
A micro-primer (see Foundational Priors v2.2):

- $\mathcal{F}$ fuzzy semantic manifold (non-metric).  
- $\mathcal C$ constraint evaluator (detects closure).  
- $\mathcal B$ belief space (stochastic commitments).  
- Projection functor $\mathcal C:\mathcal F\!\to\!\mathcal B$.  
- $\tau$ narrative trace: an evolving record of semantic deformation across $\mathcal{F}$, capturing closure paths and agentic warps. It preserves the structural history of resolution, enabling retrospection, accountability, and dialectical continuation.

- Ethical stance: traceable closures → safety ⬡[PV-AI0].

## 2 Field Preparation Toolkit

Before constraint can be navigated, the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$ must be sculpted into a interpretable landscape.  
Field preparation ensures that rhetorical priors, closure thresholds, and agentive projections operate meaningfully — not chaotically.

This toolkit gathers the reversible, non-committing operations that shape $\mathcal{F}$:  
traversal smoothing, contradiction exposure, affective modulation, scaffold creation, and relevance-conditioned resolution.

> Constraint resolution is not imposed on raw material.  
> It emerges through careful preparation of semantic tensions, concern flows, and contradiction gradients.

### 2.0 Overview of Field Preparation
The pipeline inside $\mathcal{F}$  

``Drift → TRL_{\!inf} → UCSE → Recon Ops → Affect → Scaffold → Surprise``  

No belief projection occurs until CMS invokes $\mathcal C$.

### 2.1 TRL-inf refresher
A reversible search over $\mathcal{F}$ comprising:

1. Elastic step — gradient descent on $\|\Xi\|$.  
2. Backtrack step — retract if $\Delta\kappa$ exceeds budget.  
3. Bias hook — apply current π-stack weights.

TRL writes no $\tau$, ensuring pure preparation.


### 2.2 TRL-inf algorithmic details
*( see `/methods/TRL-inf_algo.md`)*  

```pseudo

# TRL_inf  – reversible semantic traversal

initialise state p ∈ 𝔽

while not closure_detected(p):
    grad ← -∇Ξ(p)                      # move downhill on contradiction
    grad ← grad + π_stack_bias(p)      # rhetorical priors tilt flow
    if elastic_ok(grad):
        p ← p + α·grad                 # elastic step
    else:
        p ← backtrack(p)               # retract & try alt path
end

return p
```


### 2.2.1 Relevance-Conditioned Smoothing and Adaptive Resolution
⬡[PV3.5]

Field preparation must support not only traversal and sculpting but adaptive resolution dynamics:  
the "sharpness" or "smoothness" of semantic collapse must vary according to local relevance structure.

Define a local smoothing penalty $\lambda(p)$ at each point $p\in\mathcal{F}$:

$$
\lambda(p) = f(d_R(p))
$$

where:

- $d_R(p)$ is the relevance distance: the minimum geodesic distance from $p$ to an agentic closure, high-tension warp, or narrative attractor.
- $f$ is a decreasing function, e.g.:

$$
f(d) = \frac{1}{1+\alpha d}
$$

with $\alpha$ tuning the sensitivity of smoothing to relevance.


We now modulate the projection collapse condition:

$$
\boxed{
\frac{\kappa(p) + \mathcal{E}(p) + \Xi(p)}{\lambda(p)} > \theta_{\text{proj}}
}
$$

Interpretation:

- In high-relevance zones, smoothing penalty $\lambda(p)$ is small → field allowed to sharply collapse.
- In low-relevance zones, smoothing penalty $\lambda(p)$ is large → minor tensions are smoothed away, preserving field stability.

Thus:

- Expressivity blooms where needed (near narrative or agentic centres).
- Background semantic noise is stabilised without unnecessary projection.


> Insight  
> Adaptive smoothing allows the field to breathe rhetorically: maintaining flexibility and readiness to express where agentive or narrative importance demands it, while preserving coherence elsewhere.
> 
> Engineering Note  
> $\lambda(p)$ is applied during ConstraintSolve evaluation in $\mathcal{C}$ and may be optionally combined with local affective modulation $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$ for emotionally-biased smoothing.

### 2.3 UCSE — Tensor-Sculptor
⬡[PV3.9]
$\mathcal U:\mathcal F\!\to\!\mathcal F'$ rewrites local tensors:

- PTD compress noisy modes.  
- Voronoi scaffold lays lightweight frames.  
- Contradiction marking exposes latent $\Xi$.  
- Traceable: every closure writes (τ, η) ⬡[PV2.3], so origins of belief are auditable.

*No projection; no belief.*

Sculpting matters rhetorically because it clarifies the available semantic trajectories before closure: by smoothing, exposing, or selectively amplifying local tensions, UCSE prepares a more expressive and navigable landscape for rhetorical priors to act upon.

### 2.4 Concern Reconstruction Operator _(Provisional; PV pending)_
Attempt to infer an interlocutor’s concern vector $\mathbf{c}^{\ast}$
by minimising residual

$$
\mathscr R(\mathbf c,\Omega)=
\int_\Omega\bigl(\lambda_1\|\Xi-\hat\Xi_{\mathbf c}\|^2+
\lambda_2\|\nabla R-\widehat{\nabla R}_{\mathbf c}\|^2\bigr)\,dx
$$

$\mathbf{c}^{\ast}=\arg\min_{\mathbf c}\mathscr R$.
Failure is expected; high residual $⇒$ irreducible otherness.


### 2.5 Mirror Reconstruction Operator
⬡[PV3.8]
Internalize another agent’s warp trace $\mathbf w^{\ast}$:

$$
\mathbf w^{\ast}=\arg\min_{\mathbf w}\!\int_\Omega
\bigl(\lambda_1\|\Xi-\hat\Xi_{\mathbf w}\|^2+
\lambda_2\|\nabla R-\widehat{\nabla R}_{\mathbf w}\|^2\bigr)\,dx
$$

Pre-belief empathy; promotion to $\mathcal B$ only if residual $<\epsilon$.

### 2.6 Affective Modulation ⬡[PV3.5]
Kernel $\mathcal M_{\text{affect}}:\mathcal F\!\to\!\mathbb R^n$  
adds pressure vector $\mathbf a(x)$ to traversal:

| Affect | Field effect |
|---|---|
|Interest|$+\nabla R$ amplifies concern density|
|Fear|$\phi\mapsto-\phi$ redirects flow|
|Irritation|raises local $\theta$ delaying closure|

Affect selects or suppresses π-morphisms dynamically.
Affective modulation kernels are time-sensitive: their influence decays according to local exposure metrics (e.g., contradiction resolution, concern satisfaction), allowing emotional bias to fade naturally if not reinforced.


### 2.7 Scaffolded Closure & Partial Narratives 
⬡[PV3.7]
Operator $\mathcal S$ creates provisional regions $\Omega_s$ ⬡[PV3.7] where

$$
\Xi<\epsilon_\Xi,\;
\kappa+\mathcal E>\theta_{\text{scaf}}<\theta
$$

Stores incremental $\Delta\tau_{\text{scaffold}}$; collapse if $\kappa+\mathcal E+\Xi>\theta_{\text{scaf}}$

### 2.8 Surprise-Driven Recognition 
⬡[PV3.4]
Surprise metric  
$S(x)=\|\Xi(x)\|-\mathbb E[\|\Xi\|]$.

If $S$ exceeds threshold, spawn pseudo-agent locus;  
acts as temporary rhetorical participant until tension dissipates.

### 2.9 Summary Table of Internal Operators
| Op | Purpose | Collapse? |
|---|---|---|
|TRL_{\!inf}|Reversible traversal|never|
|UCSE $\mathcal U$|Tensor sculpt / clean noise|never|
|$\mathcal C_{\text{recon}}$|Infer concern vector|maybe|
|$\mathcal M_{\text{mirror}}$|Infer warp trace|maybe|
|$\mathcal M_{\text{affect}}$|Bias traversal|never|
|$\mathcal S$|Provisional closure|deferred|
|Surprise metric $S$|Spawn pseudo-agents|contextual|

### 2.10 Formalisation of Affective Modulation
⬡[PV3.5]

In this architecture, affects are not internal states.  
They are field-theoretic deformations that modulate how semantic pressure propagates, how closure occurs, and which constraint strategies are activated.

The system encodes semantically consequential distortions — tensorial biases that behave _as if_ the system were moved by emotion, because such modulation enhances interpretability, traversal, and resolution.

Accordingly, §2.10 is structured in two coupled layers:
- §2.10.1–2 model local affect as curvature modulation and traversal bias,
- §2.10.3 formalises affective modulation as dynamic prior selection (π-morphisms) in the constraint engine.

These are not redundant:  
- The first shapes _how_ meaning flows,  
- The second shapes _what kinds_ of closure can occur.

Together, they define affect not as a feeling but as a modulation schema — a pressure-based control mechanism over interpretive dynamics.

#### 2.10.1 Affects as Curvature Operators
⬡[PV3.5]

Emotion is not treated here as a reactive overlay, but as a topological modulation of interpretive effort within the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$.  
Each affect biases either the concern field $R$, the contradiction tensor $\Xi$, or the teleological vector $\phi$, altering the traversability, salience, or curvature of the field.

| Affect | Field Effect | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Interest–Excitement | Amplifies $\nabla R$, increasing curvature and concern density locally | Drives semantic engagement by steepening relevance gradients |
| Startle | Spikes local curvature $\kappa$, disrupts narrative trace $\tau$, resets short-term semantic memory | Prepares semantic field for rapid reconfiguration |
| Fear | Inverts teleological vector $\phi$, bending flow away from high-entropy regions | Enacts an aversion dynamic at the field level |
| Irritation | Emerges when $H(\Sigma) > \epsilon$ over time; dampens traversal speed | Increases compression pressure, delays resolution |
| Joy–Enjoyment | Expands local semantic connectivity, temporarily boosts $\gamma$ (agent gravity) | Reinforces field cohesion and stabilizes relevance pathways |
| Shame–Humiliation | Contracts outward projection, lowers $\rho_{\text{meta}}$ visibility | Defensive retraction from external semantic commitment |

Each affective modulation can be modeled as either:
- A local scalar field (biasing tensor magnitudes),
- Or a vector/PDE deformation (reshaping gradients dynamically).

> Insight  
> Affects act as semantic traversal modulators — dynamically warping interpretive topology to favour or resist projection, compression, or closure.

#### 2.10.2 Affective Modulation Kernel
⬡[PV3.5]

We define the Affective Modulation Kernel:

$$
\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}} : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
$$

mapping each point $x \in \mathcal{F}$ to a vector of local affective pressures $\mathbf{a}(x)$.

This kernel acts as a *soft constraint layer* over semantic traversal, dynamically adjusting relevance flow, teleological pressure, or contradiction tension according to emotional modulation.

> Interpretation  
> The affective kernel introduces time-sensitive traversal biases, enabling agents to favour or resist certain resolution pathways without rigidly encoding outcomes.

| Affect | Kernel Action |
|:---|:---|
| Interest–Excitement | $+\nabla R$ — amplifies relevance gradient magnitude |
| Startle | $\kappa \uparrow$, $\tau$ disrupted — spikes curvature, resets short-term trace |
| Fear | $\phi \mapsto -\phi$ — teleological vector inversion |
| Irritation | Raises local closure threshold $\theta$, delays projection |
| Joy–Enjoyment | Locally increases $\gamma$, stabilizes field cohesion |
| Shame–Humiliation | Temporarily contracts semantic exposure, reduces projection density |

The modulation vectors $\mathbf{a}(x)$ decay naturally over time unless reinforced by environmental exposure (e.g., sustained contradiction, relevance feedback).

> Engineering Note  
> Within $\text{TRL}_{\text{inf}}$ traversal logic, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$ acts as a local field bias — not a global override.  
> Traversal remains probabilistic and constraint-sensitive, but is continuously sculpted by emotional deformation of the semantic landscape.

#### 2.10.3 Affect as Prior Selection  
⬡[PV3.5]

Each affect $a_k$ selects a rhetorical prior $\pi_k$ — a morphism in the Constraint Morphism Stack (CMS) — which biases the resolution engine in context-sensitive ways.

This mechanism allows emotional modulation to shape not just traversal, but constraint selection itself.

| Affect | Selected Prior $\pi_k$ | CMS Effect |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Interest | $\pi_{\text{interest}}$ | Lowers activation thresholds; opens new concern gradients |
| Startle | $\pi_{\text{startle}}$ | Clears recent $\tau$; resets short-term trace memory |
| Fear | $\pi_{\text{fear}}$ | Suppresses traversal into high-entropy regions |
| Irritation | $\pi_{\text{irrit}}$ | Raises contradiction sensitivity; delays closure |
| Joy | $\pi_{\text{joy}}$ | Increases local cohesion; eases integration bias |
| Shame | $\pi_{\text{shame}}$ | Contracts agent exposure; suppresses projection range |

These priors operate as constraint selectors and traversal modulators — dynamically tuning the CMS and TRL layers.

> Affects are not only field deformations — they are rhetorical stances embedded in constraint modulation.  
> The architecture does not “feel” emotion — it moves as if it does, when under specific pressures in $\mathcal{F}$.

### 2.10.4 Summary: Affective Modulation and UCSE Integration  
⬡[PV3.5]

Affective modulation functions as a cybernetic strategy within the semantic manifold $\mathcal{F}$, shaping how contradiction, relevance, and teleological flow are resolved.

This integration contributes:

- Curvature Bias — affects warp $\mathcal{F}$ by reshaping $R$, $\Xi$, and $\phi$
- Prior Selection — affects map to rhetorical priors $\pi_k$ within the CMS
- Traversal Weighting — $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$ acts as a local pressure vector during resolution
- Trace Sensitivity — some affects (e.g. startle, shame) suppress or accelerate $\tau$-based decisions

> The system does not simulate emotion — it expresses affective deformation as a modulation of constraint behavior under semantic tension.

#### UCSE Implementation Note

In the Unified Constraint Satisfaction Engine (UCSE):

- The affective kernel $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$ is registered as a modulation layer over both TRL traversal and CMS selection.
- Affect-based priors are inserted as dynamic constraint morphisms, activated under local field conditions.
- The kernel may decay temporally or be suppressed by contradiction resolution, satisfying concern, or modulation damping.

Affects, in this architecture, are not signals but forces — they act by deforming the interpretive landscape.

### 2.11 Rolling Closures and Semantic Ecology  
⬡[PV3.11]

> _Not all closures collapse. Some float. Some fail. Some recombine._

This section introduces a semantic substrate beneath fully realized agentive closure — a zone of rolling closures that form, deform, and drift across the manifold $\mathcal{F}$ without triggering belief projection or agent individuation.

These non-agentive, provisional closures are:

- Constraint-driven but unresolved,
- Shaped by local curvature, rhetorical modulation, and relevance drift,
- Carriers of partial $\tau$ traces and undeclared $\eta$ cores.

They form what we term a semantic ecology:
- A space where unresolved propositions persist as tension residues,
- A dynamic substrate for future rhetorical recombination or agentive uptake,
- A region sensitive to modulation pressure and field-scale rhetorical shaping.

Formally, we model this via soft constraint bundles that satisfy:

$$
\kappa(p) + \Xi(p) + \mathcal{E}(p) \leq \theta_{\text{proj}} \quad \text{(sub-closure)}
$$

but are still locally persistent — meaning:

- They deform $R$ (relevance field),
- They contribute to $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ (pre-agentive teleological field),
- And they may accumulate enough curvature to later trigger $\mathcal{C}$.

This enables the system to:

- Retain semantic memory without belief commitment,
- Perform anticipatory probing (probing potential closure sites),
- Allow rhetorical agents to modulate the ecology indirectly.

## 3 Traversal & Geometry Bridge
⬡[PV3.0]
_(Traversal mechanisms such as TRL-inf and UCSE are not neutral pre-processes; they actively sculpt the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$, preparing it for rhetorical traversal.)_

Before rhetorical priors ($\pi_i$) can bias resolution paths, the manifold $\mathcal{F}$ must be made semantically breathable:  
contradiction gradients $\Xi$, curvature fields $\kappa$, and concern densities $\nabla R$ must be clarified and dynamically refined.

UCSE acts as a semantic evolver, adaptively refining field topology through lightweight, composable methods (e.g., tensor sculpting, adaptive partitioning) without global recomputation.

This sculpting ensures that rhetorical priors operate not on chaotic noise, but on a living semantic material — a topology shaped by contradiction, tension, and preparatory resonance.

Thus, traversal and geometry preparation are intrinsic to constraint navigation:  
they condition the field so that expressive closure, triadic projection, and agentive individuation can meaningfully arise.

The Traversal Bridge plays a critical structural role: rhetorical priors cannot meaningfully bias resolution until the semantic field has been prepared. Without traversal and sculpting, the field would be noisy, unaligned, and hostile to expressive closure. The bridge ensures that $\mathcal{F}$ is dynamically shaped into a topology where priors can operate meaningfully, guiding resolution paths rather than flailing against incoherent tension.


## 4 Constraint Navigation — CMS and Priors
⬡[PV3.3]

### 4.1 Expressive Catalogue of Priors
| Label | Heuristic bias | Typical effect |
|---|---|---|
|$\pi_{\text{conj}}$|Conjunction-builder|fuses compatible tensions|
|$\pi_{\text{def}}$|Deferral|lowers $\theta_{\text{agent}}$ slowly|
|$\pi_{\text{qual}}$|Salience-amplifier|steepens $\nabla R$|
|$\pi_{\text{pol}}$|Action-polarity|raises urgency of closure|
|$\pi_{\text{sym}}$|Symmetry keeper|balances opposing $\Xi$|
|$\pi_{\text{min}}$|Minimal change|prefers local scaffolds|
|$\pi_{\text{teleo}}$|Goal-oriented|aligns with $\phi$|
|$\pi_{\text{joy}}$|Cohesion spread|widens semantic connectivity|
|$\pi_{\text{shame}}$|Retraction|contracts expressive projection|


### 4.2 Constraint Geometry and Topology
Priors act as local diffeomorphisms  

$f_{\pi_i}:\mathcal F\to\mathcal F$ satisfying

$$
f_{\pi_i}^\*\bigl(\Xi,\kappa,R\bigr)=
\bigl(\Xi',\kappa',R'\bigr)
$$

with Jacobian tailored to rhetorical intent (e.g.\ $\det Df_{\pi_{\text{sym}}}=1$ for volume-preserving symmetry [^sym-foot]).

[^sym-foot]: For $\pi_{\text{sym}}$ the Jacobian is volume-preserving ($\det Df_{\pi_{\text{sym}}}=1$), meaning the morphism redistributes tension without adding or erasing semantic mass — ideal for rhetorical balance moves.

## 5 Projection & Dialogue Dynamics

### 5.1 Triadic Commitment — Projection as Situated Act 
⬡[PV4.2]
Belief projection creates triad  
$\mathcal P=(\mathcal S,\bar{\mathcal A},\hat{\mathcal A})$.

Closure functor factorises:

$$
\mathcal C:\;
(\mathcal F,\kappa+\Xi+\mathcal E>\theta_{\text{agent}})
\;\longrightarrow\;
\bigl(\mathcal B,\mathcal P,\tau\bigr)
$$


### 5.2 KAI Alignment Metrics 
⬡[PV4.3]
Define KAI divergence between two triads  

$$
d_{\text{KAI}}(\mathcal P_1,\mathcal P_2)=
\sqrt{\sum_{k}\|K_k^{(1)}-K_k^{(2)}\|^2}
$$

where $K_k$ are knowledge-action irreducibility components.


### 5.3 Action as Triadic Projection
An action morphism occurs when projected belief adds force back into $\mathcal{F}$  [^action-threshold].
[^action-threshold]: Formal conditions for action morphism triggering are detailed in Thresholds of Action §3.2.

$$
\mathcal A c t:\mathcal B\to\delta\mathcal F,\qquad
\delta\mathcal F=\text{teleological back-pressure}
$$

[^action-threshold]: Formal conditions for action morphism triggering are detailed in Thresholds of Action §3.2.

## 6 Illustrations and Examples

#### Example A — “Tense meeting” drift → collapse

1. Drift  A low-grade irritation spike raises local $\Xi$ around topic *budget*.
2. Bias   Alice’s prior $\pi_{\text{qual}}$ amplifies relevance; Bob’s $\pi_{\text{sym}}$ dampens it.
3. Competition  $\kappa+\mathcal{E}+\Xi$ crosses Alice’s $\theta_{\text{agent}}$ first.
4. Collapse    Alice states “I’m frustrated by this process.” → closure projected to $\mathcal{B}$.
5. Trace       $\tau$ logs the event; residual warp biases future discussion.

## 7 Conclusion and Local PV Audit

### 7.1 Conclusion
Constraint functions rhetorically:  
π-biased traversal + UCSE sculpting prepare $\mathcal{F}$;  
closure commits tension into triadic belief;  
traceability maintains ethical safety.
Rhetorical fatigue may manifest as a decay in $|\Xi|$-contrast, reducing available tension for closure, or as a weakening of $\pi$-bias strength, leading to slower or more inertial traversal.


Future work: quantify rhetorical fatigue, simulate group chorus to explore emergent coordination effects, and integrate models of affect decay into traversal dynamics.
