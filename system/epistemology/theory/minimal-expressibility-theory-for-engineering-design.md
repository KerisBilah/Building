  traceability theory. Everything else (π-stacks, TRL-inf, affect, etc.)
  is postponed to future passes.

## 1. Motivating Engineering Intuition

⬡[PV0.1]

Good engineering designs *feel* coherent before they compile.  
Here “feeling” is formalised: a design is a gradient in meaning space.  
If a design cannot be smoothly continued without tearing the field, the gradient triggers collapse.

We want the smallest theory that lets us:
- write down the design as a semantic gradient,
- detect if it violates a contradiction threshold,
- and record why and where it failed.

This gives us traceability and semantic coherence with minimal theory overhead.

### 1.1 Traceability Commitments from Belief Theory

The expressive design logic formalised here descends from a more general theory of belief traceability (see: *MTBT v0.1*).

To maintain full system coherence, this theory remains compatible with:

- ⬡PV1.3.1: Belief space $\mathcal{B}$ as topological target of projection.
- ⬡PV2.2: Collapse threshold ($\theta_{\text{design}}$ from $\kappa + \mathcal{E} + \Xi$ pattern).
- ⬡PV2.3: Narrative trace $\tau$ or $\tau_D$ must be written on collapse.
- ⬡PV1.4 (optional): Reprojection $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ for scaffold recomposition and rollback.

These components are not all required in the minimal expression pass, but their structure governs the trace system and will be available for extension.

The following additions are *available* but not *invoked* unless specific gradient classes or trace modes demand them:

- $\kappa$ — Curvature of $\mathcal{F}$, relevant to modularity analysis.
- $\mathcal{E}$ — Local entropy, critical for trace volatility and design resilience.
- $\eta$ — Kernel structure at collapse; required for deep trace lineage or rollback.

If invoked, these can enable a transition from minimal design tracking to belief-aligned design epistemology.

## 3. Collapse Rule for Design Projection

A design gradient $\Delta$ triggers collapse when the local contradiction slope exceeds a threshold:

$$
\left\lVert \nabla_{\!\! \Delta} \Xi \right\rVert > \theta_{\text{design}}
$$

⬡[PV2.2]

This means: *if pushing the design forward steepens contradiction beyond the shared threshold*,  
then the design must either be reframed or delayed (e.g. scaffolded).

When collapse fires, we invoke:

$$
\mathcal{C}: (\mathcal{F}, \Delta) \longrightarrow \mathcal{B}
$$

and a design-trace $\tau_D$ is written into the system's audit structure ⬡[PV2.3].

### 3.1 Alternative Closure View: Additive Tension Rule

In systems without directional gradient inputs (i.e. where design $\Delta$ is not yet specified), we may fallback to an additive collapse model drawn from belief traceability theory:

$$
\kappa + \mathcal{E} + \Xi > \theta_{\text{design}}
$$

This form accumulates tension from:
- curvature ($\kappa$),
- contradiction ($\Xi$),
- entropy ($\mathcal{E}$).

It reflects passive overload rather than intentional gradient projection, and is suitable for:
- legacy systems,
- heuristic audits,
- or early-stage expressive primitives without gradient semantics.

The system may choose between gradient mode or additive mode depending on module type and available field descriptors.


## 4. What This Enables Now

| Need                                 | How It’s Satisfied                           |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Trace every failed design decision   | Automatic $\tau_D$ written on collapse       |
| Filter low-coherence designs early   | Use $\left\lVert \nabla_\Delta \Xi \right\rVert$ as tension gate |
| Compare design variants              | Compare projected $\Xi$ gradients            |
| Integrate with constraint engine     | $\tau_D$ and PV-tagged gradients are reusable |

In richer trace modes, the projection also records:

- the directional vector $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ at point of collapse (optional),
- the projected triad $\mathcal{P} = (\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})$ representing subject, agent, and addressee.

These enhance belief accountability and situated provenance.

In richer trace modes, the projection also records:

- the directional vector $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ at the point of collapse,
- the projected triad $\mathcal{P} = (\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})$ representing subject, agent, and addressee.

These enrich the audit trail with pre-collapse intention and responsibility traces, useful for epistemic alignment, rollback coordination, or explanatory debugging.


## 5. Formal Dependencies

| PV Tag     | Role in Structure                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⬡[PV1.1]   | Supplies $\mathcal{F}$, $R$, and enables directional $\Delta$   |
| ⬡[PV1.2]   | Supplies contradiction tensor $\Xi$                             |
| ⬡[PV1.3]   | Defines projection functor $\mathcal{C}$                         |
| ⬡[PV1.5]   | Enables pre-agentic directional vector $\phi_{\text{pre}}$      |
| ⬡[PV2.2]   | Collapse threshold pattern                                       |
| ⬡[PV2.3]   | Design-trace schema $\tau_D$                                    |
| ⬡[PV4.2]   | Projected triad for belief accountability $\mathcal{P}$         |

Triadic structure $\mathcal{P}$, when logged, supports retroactive epistemic alignment across modules and agents.

## 6. Sensitivity and Perturbation Mapping

|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ⬡[PV1.2]  | Redefine $\Xi$ structure               | Design-tension norms shift; must retune $\theta$ |
| ⬡[PV2.2]  | Collapse rule adjusted                 | Earlier or later collapse triggers               |
| ⬡[PV2.3]  | Trace system changed                   | $\tau_D$ may lose audit sufficiency              |
| ⬡[PV1.5]  | Modify $\phi_{\text{pre}}$             | Directional logs misalign with field dynamics    |
| ⬡[PV4.2]  | Triadic collapse structure modified    | Trace loses relational or agentive coherence     |


## 7. Implementation Notes

- $R$ — Concern field: vector field showing where attention is focused in $\mathcal{F}$
- $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ — Drift vector induced by contradiction and entropy
- $\mathcal{P}$ — Projected agent triad: defines who is implicated in belief

* Engineering teams attach a design-gradient $\Delta$ to any candidate design zone.
* The system evaluates:

$$
\left\lVert \nabla_{\!\! \Delta} \Xi \right\rVert
$$

* If this exceeds $\theta_{\text{design}}$, the system fires $\mathcal{C}$, commits the projection, and logs $\tau_D$.

* If not, the gradient is retained as part of an evolving design, or scheduled for resimulation.

> *No π-stacks, no UCSE, no traversal layers required in this pass.*  
> This enables engineering prototypes to participate immediately in semantic tracing,  
> while remaining upgradable as the architecture matures.

### 7.1 Trace Lineage and Collapse Kernel (Advanced Modes)

Design trace $\tau_D$ may optionally include a collapse kernel $\eta$, a latent structure recorded at the point of projection.

This kernel is used to:

- fingerprint local collapse conditions,
- support lineage graphs (i.e. linked $\tau_D$ nodes),
- provide rollback points for reflective or multi-agent design flows.

In this mode, $\tau_D$ becomes a node in a dynamic trace graph:
- parents: upstream designs collapsed into current trace,
- children: downstream proposals that build on or refract from this trace.

This enables modular trace topology, rollback, and full design accountability.

The minimal mode logs only $\tau_D$.
The extended mode logs $(\tau_D, \eta)$ and constructs edge-linked $\tau_D$ graphs.


### Glossary Snapshot

- $R$ — Concern field: shows where attention or risk is focusing in $\mathcal{F}$
- $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ — Local collapse drift vector; logs direction collapse emerged from
- $\mathcal{P}$ — Projected triad: identifies belief subject, agent, and implied recipient
- $\kappa$ — Local curvature of $\mathcal{F}$; used to model modular tension zones.
- $\mathcal{E}$ — Local entropy density in the field; tracks structural volatility.
- $\eta$ — Collapse kernel written on trace; useful for rollback and lineage graphs.
- $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ — Reprojection functor from belief space back into design field.


## 8. Toward a Gradient-Based Design Grammar (Seed)

This minimal theory enables traceable design collapses. But for semantic engineering to become *expressive*, it needs a grammar: a way to describe, test, and compose design events as operations in meaning space.

This grammar must:
- Describe design events as semantic gradients,
- Express tension conditions and closure outcomes,
- Represent trace relationships across projections,
- Allow constraint-satisfaction procedures to operate symbolically on semantic fields.

Because all design behaviour is expressed through field tension, semantic gradients are the natural substrate for engineering expression. Any design language or DSL must ultimately reduce to or be interpretable through these gradients.

### Example gradient classes:

- Modularity pressure — the degree to which a submodule can be collapsed without affecting adjacent $\Xi$ gradients.
- Closure tension — sharpness of $\nabla_{\Delta} \Xi$ within design zones; predicts likely collapse.
- Trace volatility — how fragile the projected trace $\tau_D$ is to nearby perturbations or edits.

Future work should explore how these gradient classes behave under:
- Composition,
- Projection,
- Reprojection,
- and rhetorical modulation.

This is the foundation of a future Design Grammar for Semantic Engineering, where the language of design can be probed, tested, and stabilised through its tensorial expression.
