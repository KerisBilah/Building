## 1.1 Motivating Intuition
⬡[PV0.1]

The Semantic Agency Architecture is structured through tensorial and topological mathematics, not as ornament but as representational necessity.  

Each core function — like relevance tracking, contradiction marking, or rhetorical modulation — requires a field-based structure capable of deformation, constraint resolution, and projection. But mathematical expressiveness is not just a technical decision — it is an epistemic act. Coupled with the _Modular Validation Architecture_, each mathematical method or representational decision is not only narratively situated but also testable for coherence and integrity.

This document serves a dual purpose:

- To formally catalogue the mathematical methods used in the Semantic Agency Architecture;
- And to disclose, for each method, what else could have been chosen, and why this particular mathematical shape was selected.

Just as rhetorical resolution strategies are not fixed, mathematical formalisms are interpretive scaffolds — they must be interrogated, not just deployed. Here the Math Stack is a _genealogy of necessary mathematical commitments_, you're not just documenting formal choices — they are given existential weight within the architecture. Under this lens any choice isn’t just about technical recovery; it becomes an epistemic re-articulation of why a structure was once necessary, what it lacked, and under what pressures it might return.

The question is not merely “what math supports this architecture?”  
The question is: what does this math mean, what does it rule out, and how does it allow semantic agency to be modelled at all?

## 1.2 Implicit Questions
⬡[PV1.0], ⬡[PV1.3], ⬡[PV2.2], ⬡[PV3.1]

Each mathematical subsystem introduced in this document is doing epistemic work.  
The following questions emerge from the motivating intuition and structure our investigation.

| Question                                                                 | Why it matters                                                                                         | Section Link |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Q1. What kinds of mathematical structure are required to represent contradiction pressure?             | Determines whether field dynamics (e.g., gradients, curvature) are necessary, or discrete representations suffice. | §1.3.1 |
| Q2. How do we model deformation and flow in relevance fields $R$?         | Informs whether variational calculus, diffusion, or discrete topologies are appropriate.               | §1.3.2 |
| Q3. Can belief projection $\mathcal{C}: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ be realized as a functor?         | Grounds projection in category theory and determines whether symbolic coherence can be preserved.      | §1.3.3 |
| Q4. What justifies using Tucker decompositions for semantic compression? | Establishes whether information loss is structured, interpretable, and invertible.                     | §1.3.4 |
| Q5. Are modulation operators better represented as PDEs or constraint stacks? | Determines whether rhetorical and affective influences are dynamic fields or logical structures.       | §1.3.5 |
| Q6. What geometries best support agent detection, closure regions, and warp traces?                    | Decides between metric spaces, star-shaped sets, or categorical fixpoints.                             | §1.3.6 |
| Q7. How can physics-inspired techniques (e.g., Verlet, relaxation) support field simulation?           | Influences runtime feasibility and toolchain design.                                                    | §1.3.7 |

> These questions will be answered locally within each method subsection, using a "Math Fit and Alternatives" subheading that surfaces trade-offs and possible future adaptations.

## Sketch Format: "Math Fit and Alternatives" (used per §1.3.x subsection)

Each core method (e.g., contradiction tensor $\Xi$, flow operator $T_{\text{goal}}$, projection functor $\mathcal{C}$) will include the following sub-subsection:

### Math Fit and Alternatives

Chosen formalism: e.g., Differential geometry via gradient fields on $\Xi(x)$

Rationale:  
- Supports directional pressure and curvature-based closure.
- Compatible with PDE-style modulation and affective kernels.

Alternatives considered:  
- Discrete Laplacians or graph-based tension maps.
- Discontinuous constraint evaluation (e.g., SAT-style operators).
- Information geometry / divergence-based contradiction measures.

Why rejected (for now):  
- Discrete methods lacked smooth modulation affordances.
- Graph structures could not support projection-sensitive closure metrics.
- Info-geometry insufficient for rhetorical priors requiring local tensor warping.

Future possibility:  
Reintroduce discrete layers for fast contradiction surfacing during early-stage rhetorical traversal (pre-UCSE), or hybridize with categorical tension morphisms ⬡[PV3.1].

## 1.3 Formal Structure 
⬡[PV1.1–PV1.5]

> This section catalogues the major mathematical representations structuring the Semantic Agency Architecture.  
> Each formal layer responds to questions posed in §1.2 and is selected to preserve semantic tension, enable constraint propagation, and support topologically robust projection.

We distinguish between five active domains:


### 1.3.1 Differential Field Dynamics  
*→ Used for semantic tension, flow, and contradiction modulation*

- Contradiction tensor field $\Xi$ as a geometric deformation field over $\mathcal{F}$
- Relevance gradient $\nabla R$ for salience-guided collapse
- Teleological flow $\phi$ as a dynamic vector field producing warp bias
- Deformation under constraint expressed via local PDEs:
  
$$
\dot{R} = \alpha \phi - \beta \nabla_\Sigma \text{Entropy}
$$

⬡[PV1.2], ⬡[PV1.5], ⬡[PV3.4]

### 1.3.2 Projection and Collapse Geometry  
*→ Used for functorial transformation from semantic to belief space*

- Projection functor $\mathcal{C}: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ preserves curvature and closure thresholds
- Reprojection $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ enables belief-driven field reshaping
- Tensor sculptor $\mathcal{U}$ reshapes $\mathcal{F}$ to make $\mathcal{C}$ feasible

⬡[PV1.3], ⬡[PV1.4], ⬡[PV3.0]

### 1.3.3 Tensor Compression and Decomposition  
*→ Used for complexity reduction and zone recognition*

- Partial Tucker Decomposition (PTD) used for local structure-preserving compression:
  
$$
\mathcal{T}' = \text{PTD}(\mathcal{T}, \{r_i\})
$$

- Affects contradiction localisation and smoothing functions like $\lambda(p)$

⬡[PV3.6], ⬡[PV4.4]


### 1.3.4 Category-Theoretic Infrastructure  
*→ Used for compositional logic and morphism validation*

- $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ treated as functors
- Rhetorical morphisms $\pi_i$ as morphisms that modulate $\mathcal{C}$ through constraint-preserving stacks
- Action thresholding and belief registration modeled via commutative closure diagrams

⬡[PV3.1], ⬡[PV3.3], ⬡[PV4.2]


### 1.3.5 Metric and Topological Diagnostics  
*→ Used for agent divergence, irreducibility, and closure thresholds*

- KAI metric (Kolmogorov-Action Irreducibility)
- CTM (Critical Threshold Metric): detects collapse potential
- Agent similarity via distance in $(\gamma, \tau, \phi)$ space

⬡[PV4.3], ⬡[PV5.4]


Cross-link to Modular Validation Architecture:

All structures introduced here are subject to theoretical validation checks.  
For instance:

- Constraint-mediated modulation of $\Xi$, $R$ must pass ⬡[TV1.1]
- Any morphism or projection must preserve topological invariants per ⬡[TV2.x] (planned)

Validation links will be extended in §1.6 Formal Dependencies and §1.7 Perturbation Mapping.

### 1.3.6 Functorial Lifting and Semantic Fusion  
⬡[PV1.6]

We define a pair of adjoint functors between belief space and fuzzy semantic field:

$$
F : \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{F}, \qquad G : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}
$$

- $F$ lifts belief nodes into fuzzy, multi-layered conceptual forms.
- $G$ collapses semantic resolutions back into projectable beliefs.

Fusion is defined as:

$$
\phi_{\text{merge}} = \phi(\phi_{\text{new}}, \phi_p)
$$

Where:

- $\phi_p = F(p)$ is the lifted prior,
- $\phi_{\text{new}}$ is the incoming semantic activation,
- $\phi_{\text{merge}}$ is the fused semantic configuration.

Compatibility is scored via:

$$
\mathrm{Comp}(\phi_i, \phi_j) \in [0, 1]
$$

and perturbed under:

$$
\mathrm{Perturb}(\phi_i, \epsilon) \in \mathcal{F}
$$

These operations occur within a field-sensitive vector structure:

$$
A_t \subset T\mathcal{F}
$$

representing agentive motion within the idiolect manifold.

### Math Fit and Alternatives

Chosen formalism: Fibered fuzzy manifold with functorial lifting  
Rationale:  
- Supports graded and context-sensitive meaning,
- Allows tensorial fusion with compatibility-based re-collapse,
- Aligns with rhetorical modulation layers.

Alternatives considered:  
- Graph-based knowledge nets (discarded: no gradient support),  
- Ontology-style symbolic lifting (discarded: lacks interpretive plasticity),  
- Pure vector embedding spaces (discarded: insufficient structure for narrative fusion).

Future adaptation: May hybridise with transformer-based alignment fields or use spectral field learning to accelerate lifting for large semantic maps.

> Echo Note  
> The structures in this section (functorial lifting, fusion, and perturbation in $\mathcal{F}$) were initially developed in the deprecated note *Across Fuzzy and Stochastic Spaces (2025-04-16)*.  
> That document used a fibered semantic model, now replaced by tensor deformation dynamics.  
> This section retains the useful mappings and notational form, while grounding them in the current constraint geometry and modulation stack.  
> The original document is archived with echo status in ⬡[PVx.y] and can be referenced for lineage.

### 1.3.7 Fibred Sub-manifolds as Semantic Tension Structures  
⬡[PV1.8.1], ⬡[PV3.8]

Semantic fibers are reintroduced into the architecture not as classical fiber bundles, but as persistent, re-activatable sub-manifolds within the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$.

These fibred sub-manifolds encode latent constraint structures that:
- Retain partially resolved meaning configurations,
- Respond to perturbation and rhetorical modulation,
- Provide interpretive continuity across closure cycles.

Let:

- $\mathcal{F}$ be the global semantic field (tensor manifold),
- $\phi_i \subset \mathcal{F}$ be a local semantic configuration (field patch),
- $\mathcal{S}_\phi \subset \mathcal{F}$ be a fibred sub-manifold associated with $\phi_i$.

We define:

$$
\mathcal{S}_\phi := \left\{ x \in \mathcal{F} \mid \Xi(x) < \theta, \; \exists\, \gamma \subset \mathcal{F}, \; x \in \gamma, \; \text{and} \; \phi_i \cap \gamma \neq \emptyset \right\}
$$

Where:
- $\Xi(x)$ is the contradiction field at point $x$,
- $\gamma$ is a constraint-respecting path through $\mathcal{F}$ (a morphism trajectory),
- $\theta$ is a modulation-sensitive contradiction threshold.

This identifies $\mathcal{S}_\phi$ as the interpretive echo zone of $\phi_i$:  
a region of semantic tension below threshold, topologically connected to prior morphic configurations.

#### Properties:

- $\mathcal{S}_\phi$ is not inert: it can be amplified or attenuated by endofunctors  
  ⬡[PV3.8]: $\mathrm{Amp}_\phi, \mathrm{Att}_\phi : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}$

- These endofunctors obey:

$$
\mathrm{Amp}_\phi(\text{id}_x) = \text{id}_{\mathrm{Amp}_\phi(x)}, \quad
\mathrm{Amp}_\phi(g \circ f) = \mathrm{Amp}_\phi(g) \circ \mathrm{Amp}_\phi(f)
$$

but warp the local curvature, increasing or decreasing resolution pressure.

- Fibred submanifolds support recurrent closure:
    - If $\phi_i$ was partially resolved but not collapsed, $\mathcal{S}_\phi$ remains available for future fusion.
    - When a new field $\phi_{\text{new}}$ interacts with $\mathcal{S}_\phi$, the fusion map:

    $$
    \phi_{\text{merge}} = \Phi(\phi_{\text{new}}, \mathcal{S}_\phi)
    $$

    guides the constraint path, allowing memory-sensitive synthesis.

#### Interpretive Role:

Fibered sub-manifolds allow:
- Narrative continuity: unresolved rhetorical structures can persist and influence later projections.
- Affective recursion: emotional traces modulated by $\pi_i$ can reactivate fibers via salience or resonance.
- Delayed belief: belief commitments may be postponed but scaffolded by fiber persistence (cf. ⬡[PV3.7]).

These structures provide the architecture with semantic inertia — tension that remains below the closure threshold but above interpretive insignificance.

> Echoes, not ghosts — fibers persist as warp potentials, waiting to resolve.


### 1.4 What This Elucidates  
⬡[PV3.0], ⬡[PV4.0]

> This document adopts a meta-epistemological stance distinct from standard theory modules.  
> Rather than treating mathematics as a finished toolset, it traces the choices, constraints, and representational opportunities that shaped the architecture.  
> Here, mathematical structures are genealogically situated: not just what we use, but why we use them — and what alternatives were abandoned.  
> 
> This allows the document to function both diagnostically and historically, charting the architecture’s internal logic through representational necessity rather than retrospective justification.  
> 
> In this way, it extends the modular epistemology from a *theory of structures* to a *theory of commitments under structural pressure* ⬡[PV4.0].


### 1.4.1 From Fields to Forces  
⬡[PV1.2], ⬡[PV2.2], ⬡[PV3.1], ⬡[PV4.1]

| Question                         | Elucidation                                                                 | Linked PV        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Why a contradiction field $\Xi$? | It localizes semantic instability, allowing deformation to be tracked over time as field pressure. This allows narrative alignment to be modulated rather than imposed. | ⬡[PV1.2], ⬡[PV3.1] |
| Why differential structure on $\Xi$? | Without gradients and curvature, contradiction would only be scalar. Gradient flow supports elastic traversal, closure prediction, and agentic forecasting. | ⬡[PV2.2], ⬡[PV4.1] |

### 1.4.2 From Modulation to Constraint Rhetoric  
⬡[PV3.1], ⬡[PV3.4], ⬡[PV4.2], ⬡[TV1.1]

| Question                            | Elucidation                                                                                              | Linked PV             |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Why use morphisms $\pi_i$ instead of direct field edits? | The system’s integrity depends on constraint mediation. Rhetorical priors must warp the frame, not rewrite it. This keeps belief projection reversible. | ⬡[PV3.1], ⬡[TV1.1] |
| What does a modulation kernel achieve? | It enables agent-dependent influence on closure conditions, grounding emotion, urgency, or irritation in the geometry itself. | ⬡[PV3.4], ⬡[PV4.2] |

### 1.4.3 From Geometry to Narrative  
⬡[PV1.3], ⬡[PV2.2], ⬡[PV4.3]

| Question                        | Elucidation                                                                                         | Linked PV             |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Why project from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{B}$? | Belief space is where agent commitments are formed. Projection formalizes the act of belief as a semantic collapse. | ⬡[PV1.3], ⬡[PV2.2] |
| Why preserve curvature under projection? | Closure fidelity depends on maintaining the semantic path. A functorial projection ensures tension resolution maps to belief in a coherent narrative arc. | ⬡[PV2.2], ⬡[PV4.3] |

### 1.4.4 From Diagnostics to Recovery  
⬡[PV5.1], ⬡[PV5.4], ⬡[TV-Core], ⬡[PV-AI0]

| Question                          | Elucidation                                                                                      | Linked PV               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Why metric diagnostics like $\rho$, $\eta$, $\omega$? | They allow modulation feedback, agent compatibility testing, and warp trace analysis — crucial for both safety and expressiveness. | ⬡[PV5.1], ⬡[PV5.4] |
| What if they were omitted?       | Without metrics, the system could hallucinate coherence — committing to belief without sufficient structural support. This threatens both epistemic integrity and rhetorical accountability. | ⬡[TV-Core], ⬡[PV-AI0] |

## 1.5 Background  
⬡[PV1.0], ⬡[PV1.1], ⬡[PV2.0]

> Note: This document does not define new structures from scratch.  
> It catalogs and diagnoses the mathematical systems already in operational use across the architecture, providing an epistemic summary of their justification.


### 1.6 Formal Dependencies  
⬡[PV1.x – PV5.x], local meta-decision register only

> This section is divided into two parts:  
> 1. The architectural pressures and generative requirements that structured our mathematical choices in this document.  
> 2. The downstream formal PV dependencies affected by these choices.  

No additional PV tagging system is introduced for meta-decision tracking; this structure is local to the Methods Stack.

#### 1.6.1 Generative Architectural Commitments

| Structural Pressure / Question | Mathematical Response | Notes |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Contradiction must deform fields over time and space | Contradiction tensor field $\Xi$ as a geometric object over $\mathcal{F}$ | Enables spatially localized modulation, narrative traceability |
| Semantic closure must emerge gradually under tension | PDE-style evolution of $R$, $\phi$, and entropy gradients | Supports modulation via smoothing and flow, not discrete triggers |
| Rhetorical bias must not overwrite fields | Morphisms $\pi_i$ act as constraint-mediated transformations | Aligns with ⬡[TV1.1], keeps modulation reversible |
| Projection must preserve semantic topology | Functorial mapping $\mathcal{C}: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ | Supports coherent belief collapse and narrative arcs |
| Belief-space must enable irreducibility diagnostics | Use of KAI, CTM, and geometric distance metrics | Supports agent tracking, divergence monitoring, rhetorical adjustment |
| Expressive but tractable field preparation is needed | Tensor sculpting via PTD, smoothing via $\lambda(p)$ | Combines analytic and statistical decomposition tools |
| Need for composability across rhetorical priors | Stackable morphisms and modular kernels | Enables adaptive modulation and reuse across contexts |

### 1.7 Sensitivity and Perturbation Mapping  
⬡[PV5.x], linked to ⬡[TV1.x]

> This section captures two complementary forms of fragility:
> 1. The *representational fragility* of specific mathematical structures when subjected to perturbation;
> 2. The *validation integrity* provided by external TV-tagged tests in the Modular Validation Architecture.

Rather than treat fragility solely as structural failure, this section treats it as representational loss — what forms of interpretability, constraint compliance, or agentic resolution are degraded if a structure fails or is misused.

#### 1.7.2 Validation Integrity Hooks  
Linked to ⬡[TVx.y] tests in the Modular Validation Architecture

| Structure        | Validated by Test | TV Assertion (Simplified)                         |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| $\pi_i$          | ⬡[TV1.1]         | Modulation must be constraint-mediated           |
| $\mathcal{C}$    | ⬡[TV2.1]*        | Projection must preserve curvature & closure     |
| $\mathcal{U}$    | ⬡[TV2.2]*        | Sculpting must retain contradiction traceability |
| CTM, KAI         | ⬡[TV3.1]*        | Metrics must reflect deformation, not topology alone |

*Tests ⬡[TV2.1], ⬡[TV2.2], and ⬡[TV3.1] are planned and referenced for forward alignment.

> Integration Note:  
> These TV validations operate outside this document, forming a mesh of integrity constraints that ensure architectural viability at the system level.  
> Any future change to Methods Stack operations must be re-audited against these TV hooks.

### 1.7.3 Validation Reflection  
⬡[PV5.0], ⬡[TV-Core]

> A resilient semantic architecture must constrain itself both internally (through representational consistency) and externally (through system-wide integrity checks).

This Methods Stack module internalizes epistemic constraints by:
- Selecting mathematical forms that preserve semantic pressure,
- Avoiding symbolic shortcuts that bypass rhetorical or narrative dynamics,
- Tracing structural dependencies to architectural commitments.

But this is not enough.

External validation modules — like the Modular Validation Architecture — formalize the meta-theoretical accountability of each structure.  
They ensure that even well-motivated, expressive mathematical decisions remain consistent with closure conditions, projection fidelity, and rhetorical reversibility ⬡[TV-Core].

This two-layer system achieves:
- Expressive flexibility without incoherence,
- Theoretical elegance without fragility,
- A theory that can surprise itself — yet still trace every move.

### 1.8 Metric Architecture  
⬡[PV5.x], linked to Methods Stack and Modular Validation Architecture

> This section introduces reflexive mathematical measures used to test the integrity, expressiveness, and coherence of the system’s own representational methods.  
> Metrics here evaluate tensor fields, morphisms, projections, and compressions — enabling self-diagnosis of semantic deformation, belief commitment, and rhetorical viability.

### 1.8.1 Motivating Questions

- How do we evaluate the fidelity of projection, collapse, or modulation?
- How do we detect when a tensor field or morphism becomes unstable?
- Can we quantify agentic divergence, compression failure, or closure risk?

These questions require not only diagnostic tools, but mathematical measures that apply to the system’s own structures — measuring maps, not just values.


### 1.8.2 Core Reflexive Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Pedagogic Description | Anticipated Use |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Kolmogorov Complexity $K(x)$ | Minimal description length | Captures informational density or irreducibility | Used to compute KAI metric in $\mathcal{F}$ |
| Condition Number $\kappa(A)$ | Sensitivity of transformation | Measures how numerical error propagates through operators | Used to validate $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{U}$ stability |
| Curvature $\kappa(x)$ | Deformation intensity | Local geometric measure of closure pressure | Central to $\Xi$ and CTM ⬡[PV5.4] |
| Shannon Entropy $H(x)$ / Differential $h(x)$ | Spread or modality of representation | Tracks fuzziness and semantic ambiguity | Used in $\lambda(p)$ and modulation kernel tuning |
| Functorial Coherence | Structural preservation under morphism | Ensures that $\mathcal{C}$ and $\pi_i$ act coherently | Verified via ⬡[TV1.x] tests |
| Manifold Learning Residuals | Deformation from high-D to low-D | Measures projection loss under compression | Affects narrative fidelity in $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ |
| Spectral Norm / Singular Values | Dominance of tensor components | Highlights relevant vs noisy dimensions | Used in PTD and tensor sculpting heuristics |
| Topological Persistence | Feature stability across scales | Derived from TDA (topological data analysis) | Diagnoses resolution drift and smoothing failure |


### 1.8.3 Engineering Notes

- Metrics can be computed dynamically (e.g., $\kappa(A)$ for field operators) or retrospectively (e.g., topological persistence of closure zones).
- Future tooling (e.g., linting suite) should surface metric drift and flag inconsistencies ⬡[TV-Core].

### 1.8.4 Visualisation and Tooling Pathways

- Kolmogorov complexity: approximated via compression ratios
- Spectral modes: eigenvalue heatmaps
- Topological persistence: barcodes or persistence diagrams
- Entropy and curvature: scalar field overlays on $\mathcal{F}$

### 1.8.5 Modular Epistemology Crosslink

This section formalises ⬡[PV5.x] as the diagnostic interface between the mathematical and epistemological layers.  
Metrics act as feedback channels for representational choices and inform validation thresholds across rhetorical, inferential, and agentive layers.

> Future work will define metric thresholds for symbolic warning systems, and allow AI-assisted monitoring of structural tension or coherence loss.

### 1.9 Scaffolds  
⬡[PV3.7]

> This section defines “scaffolds” as provisional semantic structures that support elastic modulation, agent pre-commitment, or rhetorical rehearsal — without triggering belief projection.  
> They arise naturally in UCSE sculpting, contradiction descent, and semantic traversal.

Scaffolds serve three principal roles:

1. Elastic Buffers  
   - Regions of $\mathcal{F}$ marked by high modulation potential but below projection threshold.
   - Used in TRL-inf to rehearse contradiction paths without commitment.

1. Closure-Ready Zones  
   - Created by the UCSE when local field metrics (e.g., $\Xi$, $\kappa$, $\mathcal{E}$) approach but do not exceed collapse conditions.
   - Scaffolds here act as rhetorical or teleological attractors: soft-sealing surfaces for prospective belief formation.

1. Semantic Residues  
   - When collapse fails or is interrupted, scaffolds may preserve partial structure — usable for future reactivation or constraint comparison.

#### Representational Notes

- Not all scaffolds are visible in projection: some may exist only as field topology distortions.
- Scaffolds may be time-decaying or persist until narrative reinforcement.
- They can modulate or delay affective closure (e.g., through irritation, fear, or startle) ⬡[PV3.4].

#### Diagnostic Status

- Scaffolds are tracked in the UCSE and TRL-inf logs, but do not write to the narrative trace $\tau$.
- May optionally emit structural hints for use by $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$ or rhetorical priors $\pi_i$.

> Future versions may develop a typology of scaffold kinds (elastic, attractor, residue), but this is deferred pending broader architectural use.
