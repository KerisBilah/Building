# Modular Epistemology for Theory Modules 

## Overview

> *Internal architectural logic for the semantic agency framework.*  
> *Conforms to Foundational Priors v2.3 and Appendix A v2.3.*  
> *Last revised: May 2025.*

### Covenant: Theory–Engineering Feedback Commitment

#### Epistemic Commitment:

From this point forward, all theoretical branches are provisional.  
Each engineering attempt acts as a semantic test.  
If a theoretical path proves non-viable, it is recorded as such and the branch is closed.

#### Operational Implication:

- Theory continues freely.
- Engineering attempts are tracked as tests of theoretical structure.
- Dead ends are not discarded—they’re signposted.

“This branch was pruned because its projection could not be realised.”

#### Analogy:
Theory is a tree.  
Engineering is the act of climbing it.  
Closure happens when paths are proven walkable.
This document formalises a modular, auditable structure for epistemic and architectural claims. It defines a system of Provenance Validation ⬡[PVx.y] — a tag-based architecture for structural coherence, shared dependencies, and inter-document integrity.

This system is not just for tracing where claims come from. It is designed to:
- Modularise epistemic structures
- Validate formal and conceptual moves against shared assumptions
- Support reuse and integration across theoretical domains

The architecture assumes documents will evolve — this schema ensures they evolve coherently and remain internally valid.

> Style Note: Always insert PV tags inline (`⬡[PVx.y]`), never as hashtags, footnotes, or external links.  
> PV tags are semantically part of the sentence they validate.

This schema defines a Provenance Validation (PV) tag system that makes every claim traceable to formally specified assumptions.  
PV tags (e.g.\ ⬡`[PV2.2]`) link theory modules to a single, machine-readable header in *Appendix A – Architectural Assumptions v2.2*.

### What This Achieves  
- Modularity — every note is a pluggable module.  
- Audit-ability — change an assumption, re-audit affected notes automatically.  
- Re-use — shared formal objects (e.g.\ $R$, $\Xi$, $\mathcal{C}$) propagate unambiguously.  

## 1 Structural Template for Theory Modules 
⬡[PV0.1]

This section defines the standardised modular structure for all theory documents in the semantic agency framework.

Each module follows a seven-part pattern, designed for:

- Human interpretability (conceptual clarity)
- Machine auditability (PV-traceable validation)
- Sensitivity resilience (explicit perturbation handling)

Formal claims, dependencies, and resolution strategies must be PV-tagged according to this template.

> Validation Reminder: Any deviation from this template must insert a local PV deviation notice, e.g., "⬡[PV-Template-Override]".

The canonical checklist follows below.

### 1.0.1 PV Conformance Checklist

| Section                            | Role                | Mandatory PV Ranges            | ✔   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | --- |
| 1.1 Motivating Intuition           | Conceptual anchor   | ⬡PV0.x                         |     |
| 1.2 Implicit Questions             | Diagnostic scope    | ⬡PV1.x – 2.x                   |     |
| 1.3 Formal Structure               | Maths + logic       | ⬡PV1.x – 3.x (+5.x if metrics) |     |
| 1.4 What This Elucidates           | Interpretation      | ⬡PV3.x – 4.x                   |     |
| 1.5 Background                     | Dependency trace    | relevant ⬡PV1–4                |     |
| 1.6 Formal Dependencies            | Audit table         | all cited PVs                  |     |
| 1.7 Sensitivity Mapping            | Perturbation impact | all critical PVs               |     |
| 1.8 Metric Architecture (Optional) | Adaptive viability  | ⬡PV5.x                         |     |
| 1.9 Scaffolds (Optional)           | Narrative rehearsal | ⬡PV3.7                         |     |
*(Sections 1.8–1.9 may be omitted if irrelevant.)*

> Style Rule: Always write PV codes inline with a non-breaking space after them (e.g., `Closure occurs ⬡[PV2.2].`), and immediately below a section heading

### 1.1 Motivating Intuition

A reader-accessible entry point: poses a conceptual, felt, or operational problem.

- _Why this section exists:_  
  To make the formal problem recognisable as a situated, human issue.
- _Validation implication:_  
  ⬡[PV0.1] — This section needs no formal validation, but it defines the "semantic task" the formal model addresses.

Motivating intuitions should avoid technical language unless essential.

> Style Note: No LaTeX, no PV tags inside the main intuition paragraph.  
> Formal objects may be referenced lightly in parentheses, but without LaTeX formatting unless necessary.

### 1.2 Implicit Questions

This section surfaces the latent interrogatives embedded in the motivating intuition.  
It acts as a diagnostic map of what the Formal Structure must address.

- _Role:_  
  Orient what must be elucidated or formalised.
- _Links forward to:_  
  ⬡[PV1.x] (object-level constructs), ⬡[PV2.x] (closure & constraint structures).

Example table:

| Question                                                    | Why it matters                                      | Linked PV          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Q1. How does semantic tension survive without agents?       | Frames pre-agentive field as coherent, not noise.    | ⬡[PV1.5]           |
| Q2. What structures survive compression into belief?        | Identifies conditions for functorial collapse.      | ⬡[PV1.3], ⬡[PV2.2] |
| Q3. How is ownership of meaning triggered?                  | Sets thresholds for agency and closure.             | ⬡[PV2.2]           |
| Q4. How do triadic projections emerge from survival events? | Grounds agent, addressee, and subject.              | ⬡[PV4.2]           |
| Q5. Why is survival not mere compression?                   | Distinguishes agentive formation from passive loss. | ⬡[PV1.2], ⬡[PV3.1] |

> Style Note: Questions should be crisp (≤ 15 words ideally). No bold inside tables. PV tags go into the "Linked PV" column only.

### 1.3 Formal Structure

This section introduces the formal or mathematical structures that answer the implicit questions.

- _Role:_  
  Define declarative structures (manifolds, tensors, functors, operators).
- _Validation:_  
  All formal objects and mappings must cite appropriate ⬡[PVx.y] tags.

Common elements:

- Spaces ($\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{B}$)
- Functors ($\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$)
- Tensors ($R$, $\Xi$, $\tau$)
- Morphisms ($\pi_i$)
- Metrics (KAI, CTM)

> Style Note: Always wrap LaTeX objects in single `$...$` for inline (without spaces before or after the latex), `$$...$$` for block equations.  
> Never bold object names inside math (e.g., $\mathcal{F}$ not $\mathcal{F}$).


### 1.4 What This Elucidates

- _Role:_  
  Provide functional and heuristic insight or cybernetic interpretations of formal definitions supporting interpretability, not just validity.
- _Validation:_  
  Interpretations must trace back to the PV tags of the Formal Structure (typically ⬡[PV3.x] and ⬡[PV4.x]).

Suggested format:

| Question → Elucidation | Linked PV |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| How is meaning stabilized? | Via closure under contradiction pressure ⬡[PV2.2]. |
| How does agency emerge? | Through warp irreducibility in $\mathcal{F}$ ⬡[PV4.1]. |

> Style Note: Avoid rhetorical flourish. Use compact, technical sentences even in the interpretive layer.

### 1.5 Background

This section establishes the dependency trace and documents structural inheritance and upstream dependencies.

- _Role:_  
  Ground the current module in prior mathematical definitions, architectural principles, Foundational Priors (⬡[PV1.x]), closure and constraint assumptions (⬡[PV2.x])
- _Validation:_  
  Explicit PV-tag references (typically ⬡[PV1.x] and ⬡[PV2.x]).

Typical inclusions:

- Foundational Priors versions linked
- Inherited formalisms noted
- Architectural constraints clarified (e.g., stochasticity of $\mathcal{B}$ ⬡[PV1.3.1])

> Style Note: No new formalism should be introduced here. Background is purely relational and historical.

### 1.6 Formal Dependencies

This section lists all formal PV tag dependencies for the document.

| PV Tag   | Depends on formal object(s) |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| ⬡PV1.1   | Relevance field $R$           |
| ⬡PV1.2   | Contradiction tensor $\Xi$    |
| ⬡PV1.3   | Projection functor $\mathcal{C}$ |
| ⬡PV2.2   | Closure thresholding           |
| ⬡PV3.1   | Rhetorical morphisms $\pi_i$   |
| ...      | ...                           |

> Style Note: Always use a table format.  
> Do not summarise dependencies in prose; keep strictly tabular for grep-ability and automation.

### 1.7 Sensitivity and Perturbation Mapping

This section diagnoses the fragility of structural assumptions.

| PV Code  | If it changes …                          | Consequence                                     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ⬡PV1.3   | $\mathcal{C}$ loses functoriality         | Belief projection becomes incoherent           |
| ⬡PV2.2   | Closure threshold altered                | Closure events fire inconsistently             |
| ⬡PV3.1   | Rhetorical morphisms removed             | Constraint modulation fails                    |
| ⬡PV4.2   | Triadic schema dropped                   | Loss of agentive interpretive reference         |
| ⬡PV5.4   | CTM undefined                            | No structural trigger for adaptive reorganization |

- _Role:_  
  Forecast which parts of the architecture break if a PV-tagged dependency mutates.
- _Validation:_  
  Sensitivity table must match PV definitions in [[Appendix – Architectural Assumptions v2.2]].

> Style Note: No narrative commentary here. Only structured "If / Then" diagnostics.


## 2. Provenance Validation System (PVS)
A lightweight inline marker that binds a clause to a canonical assumption:
The Provenance Validation System provides structural anchoring for all formal, rhetorical, and interpretive moves across the semantic agency framework.

A PV (Provenance Validation) tag:

- Declares:  
  "This clause relies on specific foundational assumptions."
- Anchors:  
  A formal object, constraint rule, or rhetorical structure.
- Connects:  
  Across documents, ensuring modular coherence.

> Style Note: Always insert PV tags inline with the validated claim (except in section headers, then immediately underneath), not in footnotes or parentheticals.

### 2.1 PV Syntax

Use the format:

```markdown
⬡[PVx.y]
```


### 2.2 Why use the hexagonal PV tags?  

We write provenance like this: `⬡[PV2.2]`, not `[[PV2.2]]` or `#PV2.2`.

| Symbol | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| ⬡ | Decorative glyph. Visually pop the tag in flow without conflicting with Obsidian syntax. |
| [PVx.y] | Single brackets. Distinct from Obsidian wikilinks (`[[Link]]`) and searchable. |
| No hashtags | We avoid `#PV2.2` because it pollutes the tag space intended for topics. |

This way:

- Normal search (`Ctrl/⌘ + F`) finds PV uses.
- No unwanted link navigation.
- Lightweight Markdown stays human-readable.
- Dataview and grep can extract PV mentions without extra parsing.


### 2.3 Example of PV tag use  

```markdown
The closure condition fires when curvature, contradiction, and entropy gradients exceed a threshold ⬡[PV2.2].
```

## 3. ⬡ Provenance Validation Schema (PVS)

This section summarises the core PV codes available as of Foundational Priors v2.2.

| PV Tag  | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ⬡PV1.x  | Formal object definitions (e.g., $R$, $\Xi$, $\mathcal{C}$) |
| ⬡PV2.x  | Closure and constraint systems |
| ⬡PV3.x  | Rhetorical and morphism structures |
| ⬡PV4.x  | Interpretive geometric structures |
| ⬡PV5.x  | Metric architecture for viability under compression |
| ⬡PV6.x  | Concern reconstruction operators |
| ⬡PV-AI0 | Ethical safety orientation |

> Style Note:  
> Always display PV codes in a tabular format when presenting a group.  
> Single PV citations inside paragraphs should be inline and unobtrusive.

### 3.1 Full PV Definition Reference

For full canonical definitions, refer to:

- [[Appendix – Architectural Assumptions v2.2]]

The Appendix provides a machine-readable YAML version for programmatic checking.

## 4. Using PV in Your Documents

How to correctly use Provenance Validation (PV) in theory writing:

1. Insert PV Tags Inline  
   - Place `⬡[PVx.y]` immediately after the clause it validates, except in section headers then immediately below it.
   - Do not defer tags to footnotes or endnotes.

1. Cite PV Early  
   - Introduce PV tags as soon as the formal object or rhetorical structure is deployed.
   - Example:  
     "Closure occurs only when $\kappa + \mathcal{E} + \Xi > \theta$ ⬡[PV2.2]."

2. Respect Structural Template  
   - Ensure PV citations match the section roles:
     - Formal Structure → ⬡[PV1.x], ⬡[PV2.x]
     - Interpretive Layers → ⬡[PV3.x], ⬡[PV4.x]

2. Audit Readiness  
   - Each PV tag acts as an audit point.
   - Structural drift without PV revalidation is disallowed.

2. Avoid Overloading  
   - Attach each PV tag only where structurally necessary.
   - No "PV spamming" across unrelated rhetorical moves.

> Reminder: Provenance Validation is not a citation system — it is a structural audit system ensuring modular theoretical coherence.

## 5. Change Management and Re-Audit

The Modular Epistemology system enables graceful handling of change through explicit PV-tracing.

### 5.1 What Happens When a PV Assumption Changes

If a PV-tagged assumption (e.g., ⬡[PV1.2]) changes:

- Scan for all references to that tag across documents.
- Identify structurally dependent clauses.
- Evaluate whether they require update, revalidation, or formal versioning.

> Example:  
> Redefining the closure condition ⬡[PV2.2] would require re-auditing all documents that declare closure criteria.

### 5.2 Versioning

If a structural PV assumption changes meaningfully:

- Bump the PV version (e.g., ⬡[PV1.2] → ⬡[PV1.2.1])
- Update the PV header in Appendix A.
- Update dependent documents incrementally.

> Style Rule: Never reuse a PV tag across incompatible definitions.  
> Always increment if semantics change.

### 5.3 Audit Metadata

Each document must carry a YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title:
aliases:
pv_tags:
tags:
status: 
version:
version-notes:
created:
updated: 
project: 
priority: 
author:
related:
summary:
audit:
  status:
  last_audit:
  notes:
---
```

Each document must carry minimal audit metadata (in YAML frontmatter or internal footer):

```yaml
audit:
  status: "Manual audit completed"
  last_audit: "2025-04-25"
  notes: "Validated against PV1–PV4 structure. Re-audit needed if PV3.1 or PV4.2 modified."
```

## 6. Commentary and Analogues

The Modular Epistemology draws conceptual inspiration from several formal systems:

| System                  | Conceptual Analogy                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Type Theory (Coq, Agda)  | Provenance tags ≈ dependent types        |
| Category Theory          | Morphisms preserving structure           |
| Software Verification    | Contract checking, refinement typing    |
| Knowledge Representation | Ontology versioning and module linking   |

However, this system is uniquely:

- Human-readable and composable
- Structurally traced across narrative, rhetoric, and topology
- Optimized for gradual, auditable evolution

> Style Note: This section is narrative. No PV tags required inside commentary unless structurally relevant.

## 7. Two Layers of Foundational Priors

Foundational assumptions exist in two layers to separate explanation from enforcement.

| Layer                | File                                         | Role                                   | Audience                 | PV Relationship |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Narrated Pedagogic   | [[Foundational Priors v2.2]]                 | Human-readable exposition             | Researchers, newcomers  | *Declares* PV tags |
| Minimal Spec Machine | [[Appendix – Architectural Assumptions v2.2]] | Machine-readable YAML header          | Scripts, tools, CI tests | *Defines* PV tags |

### 7.1 Why Split Them?

- Audit Hygiene:  
  Commentary can evolve without destabilizing the structural definitions.
- Pedagogic Flexibility:  
  Explanatory documents can include diagrams, examples, and optional sidebars.
- Tooling Friendliness:  
  Machine-readable YAML can be parsed directly by build pipelines, IDEs, or validation scripts.

> Style Reminder: In human-facing documents, PV tags declare assumptions.  
> In machine-facing documents, PV tags define assumptions.

## 8. Style Notes for LaTeX, TikZ, SageMath, and Obsidian Markdown

This section defines style conventions for mathematical expressions, diagrams, and markup across the Semantic Agency Architecture.

### 8.1 LaTeX Formatting Rules

- Inline math:  
  Use single dollar signs: `$E = mc^2$`
- Block math:  
  Use double dollar signs on their own line:

```markdown
$$
E = mc^2
$$
```

- No bolding inside math:  
    Do not bold formal objects (e.g., no `\mathbf{F}` for $\mathcal{F}$ unless explicitly noted).
    
- Avoid redundant parentheses:  
    Minimize visual clutter; prefer clean expressions.
    

> Style Reminder: LaTeX inside Obsidian requires no additional packages; Obsidian automatically renders `$...$` and `$$...$$` blocks.

### 8.2 TikZ and SageMath Diagrams

- Primary Tool:  
    Use SageMath for diagram generation wherever possible.
    
- TikZ diagrams:  
    If needed, maintain a clear separation between text and diagram code.
    
- Image export:  
    Always save diagrams in `/visual-assets/` folder, with filenames corresponding to PV tags if diagram validates a PV structure.


### 8.3 Obsidian Markdown Best Practices

- Section headings:  
    Use `#`, `##`, `###`, consistent with hierarchical structure (1, 2, 3 levels only).
    
- Lists:  
    Always use `-` or `*` for unordered lists.  
    Use `1. 2. 3.` for ordered steps if necessary.
    
- Tables:  
    Always use Markdown pipe `|` syntax for tables.  
    Never embed HTML or nonstandard table syntax.
    
- No horizontal rules:  
    Do not use `---` or `___` for visual separation.  
    Instead, use empty space and clear heading structure.
    
- No bolded body text:  
    Bold (`bold`) is reserved only for section headings inside a note.  
    Never bold words for emphasis inside paragraphs.
    
- Italics permitted sparingly:  
    Italics (`*italics*`) can be used for:
    
    - Defining roles (e.g., _declarative layer_)
        
    - Soft emphasis (e.g., _gradual collapse_)
        
- PV tags placement:  
    PV tags (⬡[PVx.y]) must appear immediately after the clause they validate, never on a new line.
    

> Style Philosophy:  
> The aesthetic aims for clean modularity, cognitive ease, and minimal visual noise.  
> Structure should be visible through headings and tables — not ornamentation.
