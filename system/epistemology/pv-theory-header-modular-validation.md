# Sensitivity matrix
sensitivity:
  PV1.3: "Lose functorial 𝓒 → belief projection incoherent"
  PV1.4: "Remove reprojection → no feedback from belief to meaning"
  PV1.5: "Remove φ_pre → no pre-agentive tension; closure emergence becomes arbitrary"
  PV1.6: "Drop functorial lifting F → semantic reinterpretation becomes static; belief loses access to field dynamics; reactivation of stored concepts becomes brittle"
  PV2.2: "Remove threshold → no closure trigger"
  PV3.1: "Drop πᵢ → resolution loses rhetorical modulation"
  PV3.3: "CMS not compositional → constraint stack breaks"
  PV3.4: "Remove ModKernel → agents can’t modulate contradiction, collapse conditions fail dynamically"
  PV3.5: "Relevance-Conditioned Smoothing λ(p): local scalar that decreases with relevance distance d_R and modulates collapse sharpness."
  PV3.6: "Statistical Realisation of λ(p): adaptive spline or fuzzy-regression implementation providing continuous, data-driven λ(p)."
  PV3.7: "Remove Amp / Att → field loses dynamic salience control; rhetorical escalation & damping fail"
  PV3.8: "Remove Scaffold Operator → narrative rehearsal layer lost"
  PV4.2: "Agent projection loses referential geometry"
  PV4.3: "d_KAI undefined → no agent-divergence metric"
  PV4.4: "Agent similarity index ℰ(𝒜ᵢ,𝒜ⱼ) computed via (γ, τ, φ) field alignment"
  PV5.1: "Dynamic field tension metrics undefined → no adaptive stability under perturbation"
  PV5.2: "Variety mismatch undefined → no diagnosis of expressive divergence"
  PV5.3: "Compressibility-Stress Metric undefined"
  PV5.4: "Critical Threshold Metric (CTM) undefined"
  PV-AI0: "Drop ethical framing → misdiagnosis of agency emergence; safety audits lose coherence"

### Cross-walk PV Mapping ⬡[PV-Crosswalk]

> *Machine-parseable table aligning key Theory PV codes with their Engineering PV-E counterparts.*  
> Keep in `/spec/crosswalk.yaml`; bump whenever either header revises a mapped tag.

```yaml
# /spec/crosswalk.yaml
crosswalk:
  PV2.2:  PV-E5.1   # Closure risk ↔ risk & trade-off catalogue
  PV3.4:  PV-E13.2  # Modulation kernel ↔ curvature declaration
  PV4.2:  PV-E14.1  # Triadic / tranche geometry ↔ tranche coordination
  PV5.4:  PV-E12.4  # CTM metric ↔ scheduling compliance

# version: 2.2
# last_updated: 2025-04-25
# status: stable
# document: Foundational Priors v2.2
#———————————————#
pv:
  PV0.1: "Motivating intuitions do not require validation; they define semantic task-space."

  # Formal Objects
  PV1.1: "Relevance field R : 𝓕 → ℝⁿ defines agent salience and concern."
  PV1.2: "Contradiction field Ξ is the deformation gradient over 𝓕."
  PV1.3: "Projection functor 𝓒 : 𝓕 → 𝓑 preserves topological warp structure during closure."
  PV1.3.1: "If belief space is treated as a discrete graph instead of a stochastic field, projection continuity and agentive closure topology are broken."
  PV1.4: "Reprojection functor 𝓒⁻¹ : 𝓑 → 𝓕 enables belief-driven field reshaping."
  PV1.5: "Pre-agentive teleological field φ_pre : 𝓕 → T𝓕 arises from intrinsic contradiction and entropy gradients."
  PV1.6: "Lifting functor F : 𝓑 → 𝓕 expands belief nodes into fuzzy, agent-relative conceptual forms; paired collapse functor G : 𝓕 → 𝓑 allows semantic fusion to return to belief space. Enables idiolect-based modulation, rhetorical traceability, and contextual reinterpretation."

  # Closure and Constraint
  PV2.1: "Cone of concern: bounded region defined by φ, R, and κ."
  PV2.2: "Closure occurs only when κ + ℰ + Ξ > θ."

  PV3.1: "Rhetorical morphisms πᵢ modulate 𝓒 under contradiction."
  PV3.2: "All rhetorical priors πᵢ preserve narrative continuity via τ."

  PV3.4: "Modulation Kernel enables agents to locally reshape contradiction and sustain partial legibility."
  PV3.5: "Relevance-Conditioned Smoothing λ(p): scalar penalty field over 𝓕 that decreases with relevance distance d_R(p); modulates collapse sharpness and protects peripheral semantic zones from premature projection."
  PV3.6: "Statistical Realisation of λ(p): implements PV3.5 using adaptive spline smoothing or fuzzy regression; ensures continuity and local flexibility during constraint resolution."

  PV3.7: "Scaffold Operator — enables provisional closure and narrative rehearsal."

  # Interpretive Geometry
  PV4.1: "KAI index computes semantic compression failure."
  PV4.2: "Triadic projection schema ℙ = (𝒮, 𝔸̄, Â) defines agentive interpretation structure in 𝓑."
  PV4.3: "d_KAI = divergence metric computing structural dissimilarity between irreducible agent projections via τ and η."
  PV4.4: "Agent similarity index ℰ(𝒜ᵢ,𝒜ⱼ) computed via field-alignment of γ (warp), τ (trace), and φ (teleology)."

  # Metric Architecture
  PV5.1: "Dynamic tension metrics for adaptive stability."
  PV5.2: "Variety Mismatch Metric (VMM)."
  PV5.3: "Compressibility-Stress Metric."
  PV5.4: "Critical Threshold Metric (CTM): Collapse occurs when CTM(x) > θ_U, distinct from closure threshold θ (⬡PV2.2)"


  # Concern Reconstruction
