##  Systematic Evaluation System Description

### 1. Purpose and Strengths
Purpose:
An overview of how fuzzy semantics, agentivity, memory, and interpretation unfold in a probabilistic framework of discourse and thought.
Already contains:
- A layered model of concept formation and transformation
- Agentive dynamics (Gärdenfors + force vectors)
- Multi-channel interpretation as fiber-like traversal
- A sheaf-theoretic memory intuition
- A formal sketch (with maps, manifolds, and fiber inverses)  

What it does beautifully:
- Provides a narrative conceptual flow from fuzzy meaning to belief update
- Uses a toy example to illustrate cross-modal meaning
- Frames agentivity as a vector field in semantic space (this holds up!)
- Suggests sheaf-like memory—still compatible with your current design

| Concept                          | In Original           | In Position Paper                | Compatible   | Update                                          |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Base / Fiber distinction         | Implied but unclear   | Explicit, formalized             | Conceptually | Yes                                             |
| Fiber Typing                     | Mentioned informally  | Required for compatibility logic | Partial      | Yes                                             |
| $F: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ | Mentioned             | Central structuring device       | Yes          | Needs expansion                                 |
| Sheaf Memory                     | Strong metaphorically | Described structurally           | Compatible   | Needs anchoring                                 |
| Agentive vectors                 | Very well presented   | Treated as tensorial curvature   | Strong       | Re-frame in terms of base shaping               |
| Markov structure                 | Explicit              | Used implicitly                  | Holds up     | Consider making stochastic category more formal |
### 3. Revision Plan
#### Rename / Replace:
Create a new version of the document under the title:

> “System Architecture Overview (Formalised)”

 ####  What to Preserve:
- Fuzzy lexicon as idiolect
- Fusion events as context-driven constraint resolution
- Agentive geometry
- Multi-fiber traversal (will now be fiber-typed)
- Sheaf-like memory
####  What to Translate / Update:

- Define $\mathcal{F}$ explicitly as a category of constraint-resolved configurations
- Frame $\mathcal{B}$ as a concern-indexed belief manifold
- Clarify that fibers are typed configuration spaces, not just modal channels
- Replace transition functions with categorical morphisms or functorial updates
- Define the fusion operator $\phi$ as a morphism in $\mathcal{F}$
- Memory as a sheaf-valued functor or indexed semantic store
- Introduce fiber typing explicitly (e.g. rhetorical mode, modality, cognitive frame)
