# 25-04-16 Document Map

### Overview of Key Materials and Thematic Dependencies
_This document serves as a high-level summary and audit of the primary working documents in the evolving semantic architecture project. It includes functional descriptions, cross-references, and provisional annotations for zones of underformalism, incompatibility, or pending integration._
## I. System Overview Documents

### 1. System Description
Function: Top-level overview of the model’s components, flow, and purpose. Likely contains early architectural language and legacy vocabulary.  

Status: Foundational, but likely requires revision to align with current fibered and categorical structures.  
Open Questions:
- Does it reflect the functorial formulation from $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$?
- Does it distinguish clearly between base tensors and fiber contents?

Actioned:  
Replaced by: *System Architecture Overview (Formalised)*  
Purpose: Early architectural sketch grounded in a rich metaphorical system of fuzzy meanings, agentive vectors, and memory sheaves.  
Status: Superseded.  
Updated Version: Introduces formal category-theoretic distinctions between fuzzy and stochastic layers, typed fibers, and functorial mappings.  
Transition Notes:
- All components preserved in spirit.  
- Structure reframed in terms of categorical objects, morphisms, and typed fiber interactions.  
- Updated to align with *"25-04-16 Position Paper-Reinforcing the Category-Theoretic Foundations of a Fibered Semantic Architecture" position paper._

### 2. Scaffolding for a Theory of Semantic Field Dynamics  
Function: Pre-formal philosophical and design sketch of the fuzzy semantic field layer.  
Status: Core conceptual groundwork; now annotated and harmonised with the categorical model.  
Open Questions (Resolved or Reframed):
-  Fiber structure is now understood as typed configuration spaces within $\mathcal{F}$.
-  Base tensor should be defined in terms of relevance curvature, shaped by constraint saturation and argumentative mass.
- ↪ Constraint types, field tension, and metaphorical shifts are now candidates for formal morphism-based modeling.

Actioned:  
Retained and Annotated.  
- Aligned with *Reinforcing Category-Theoretic Foundations* via inline notes.
- Provides intuitive and conceptual grounding for later formal modules.
- Serves as a bridge between metaphorical insight and categorical implementation.

## II. Core Bridging & Translation Documents
### 3. Across Fuzzy and Stochastic Spaces  
Function: Early formal and narrative walk-through of how propositions traverse belief and semantic spaces.  
Status: Strong alignment with categorical structure; currently marked for reinterpretation in light of tensor-based semantics.  
Open Questions (Pending Tensor Reformulation):  
- Will functorial mappings remain one-to-one or become lossy, lossy-compressive in tensor space?  
- How do we model energetic feedback from $\mathcal{B}$ to $\mathcal{F}$ in a tensorial field—strain, surprise, rhetorical inertia?  

Actioned:  
- Document updated with Position Paper–aligned comments clarifying tensor reformulation.  
- Further update pending release of Material Tensor Argumentation Position Paper (in progress).  
- Useful as a transitional reference between fiber formalism and tensor geometry.

### 4. Fibred Semantic & Stochastic Spaces
Function: Defines typed fibers, constraint morphisms, and relevance-curved base tensors.  
Status: Current and foundational. Integrates multiple prior intuitions into a category-consistent formalism.  
Open Questions:
- How should cross-fiber comparisons be modelled? Sheaves? Indexed categories?
- Should the stochastic base be reformulated as a concern-based dynamic manifold?
### 5. Prior Flow Update  
Function: Describes the temporal unfolding of propositions: their lifting into a semantic field, constraint-driven synthesis, and re-collapse into belief space.  
Status: Structurally sound under both fiber and tensor interpretations. Fully aligned with functorial architecture.  
Open Questions:  
- Could re-lifting be modelled as an adjoint or cofunctor—capturing a reversible deformation, not just a re-expression?  
- How is long-range semantic memory encoded in the curvature or homotopy class of the belief manifold?  
- What governs the attenuation or decay of latent (unresolved) configurations in semantic time?

Actioned:  
- Fully annotated for compatibility with the Material Tensor Argumentation framework.  
- Fiber terminology retained provisionally, but now interpreted as high-dimensional tensor substructures.  
- Formal operations (lifting, perturbation, collapse) reframed as tensor dynamics with categorical mappings preserved.  
- Endofunctors confirmed as core internal modulation mechanisms in $\mathcal{F}$.

## III. Formal Structures and Transformations
### 6. Endofunctors  
Function: Early conceptual sketch identifying cybernetic modulation (amplification, attenuation) as internal endofunctorial transformations on semantic space.  
Status: Highly compatible with tensorial reformulation; no fiber assumptions are structurally binding.  
Open Questions:  
- Can amplification and attenuation be composed as functor pairs or scaled semiring morphisms?  
- Do they form part of a larger monoidal or enriched category structure within $\mathcal{F}$?  
- What is the relationship between endofunctorial modulation and rhetorical curvature?  

Actioned:  
- Fully updated with annotations referencing the Material Tensor Argumentation trajectory.  
- Endofunctors now interpreted as scalar or curvature-transforming operators on semantic tensors.  
- Document retained and promoted as foundational to the system’s dynamical control layer.

### 7. Unified Constraint System (UCS)  
Function: Defines how semantic structures (lexical tensors) are composed, modulated, and resolved through constraint satisfaction across a high-dimensional semantic space. Serves as the engine of fusion, contradiction detection, and rhetorical repair.  
Status: Fully compatible with the transition to tensorial semantics. Offers rich compositional logic, topological coherence evaluation, and mechanisms for discourse dynamics.  

> ⚠️ April 2025 Update: The UCS no longer relies on fibered architecture. “Fibers” are reinterpreted as typed tensor regions within a shared manifold. The UCS now operates over this space through *field deformation*, *semantic condensation*, and *cybernetic endofunctors* (amplification/attenuation).  

#### Highlights:
- Constraint Composition: Governs semantic fusion, guided by compatibility, relevance, and agentive alignment.  
- Prolog-style Backchaining: Recursively evaluates potential semantic alignments and contradictions, not by logic symbols but by tensor geometry.  
- Pseudo-Markovian Closures: Local zones of synthesis form dynamically, approximating Markov blankets—zones of coherence, bounded by inference and constraint saturation.  
- Contradiction Geometry: Structural failure (non-fusibility) is modeled as tension ridges, topological folds, or incompatibility fields.  
- Event-Based Cycles: Each UCS pass produces a closed semantic region that feeds forward into belief space, and may re-emerge in future compositional attempts.  

#### Open Questions:
- Can the UCS be fully re-cast as a functor on constraint categories, where morphisms describe constraint deformation over time?
- Are “failures” in fusion properly modeled as singularities or degeneracies in the tensor manifold?
- What is the relationship between constraint fields and agent modeling—can we derive agentive structures from persistent closure attempts?
- Should the UCS also handle epistemic decay (e.g., rhetorical fatigue, attentional dropout) via entropic metrics on unresolved fields?

#### Action:
Confirmed as structurally aligned with the new Material Tensor Argumentation framework.  
Will be cited and elaborated in Position Paper sections:  
- §3.0 (*Semantic Topology & Contradiction*)  
- §4.1 (*Modulation as Endofunctor*)  
- §5.0 (*Fracture and Rhetorical Stress Geometry*) 
## IV. Comparative and Meta-Level Documents
### 8. Two Worlds
Function: A conceptual contrast between stochastic and fuzzy layers—likely predates fiber formalism.  
Status: Philosophically rich; structurally looser.  
Open Questions:
- Should this be rewritten in terms of dual categories or functor/adjoint pairs?
- Is this a legacy document or still an interpretive bridge?
### 9. Unified Framework from Fuzzy Conceptual Terrain to Belief Update (ANBAC)
Function: Attempts to show the full arc from fuzzy interpretation to inference and belief revision.  
Status: Ambitious integration doc—needs to be reconciled with current fibered view.  
Open Questions:
- Can this document anchor the final formal pipeline from $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$?
- Where does it assume symbolic formalisms that have since been replaced?
## V. Agency and Interpretation
### 10. A Minimal Theory of Agency
Function: Core philosophical and computational framework for the emergence of agency from complexity, compression failure, and semantic constraint.
Status: Canonical. Integrates causal semantics, event-driven modeling, and relevance topology.
Open Questions:
- How does this framework interface with tensorial failure/recovery dynamics in the UCS?
- How can pseudo-Markov closures (emergent inference zones) be formally described?
- Can relevance-based proximity be made computationally tractable as a distance function?
