## Most Exciting Alternatives to the Fiber Model

This document surveys promising alternatives and structural generalisations that extend or replace the fiber bundle model in the evolving semantic agency architecture. These alternatives emerge naturally from the transition to a tensorial representation space and open new directions for implementation, formalisation, and theoretical development.

## 1. Curvature-Projected Local Goal Logic  
**Replaces**: Fixed goal-structured fibers at each event
- **Concept**: Infer dynamic local goal graphs from curvature in the semantic tensor field.
- **Mechanism**: 
  - Concavity basins → potential goals
  - Curvature ridges → inferred obstacles or barriers
- **Advantage**: Integrates goal logic and relevance flow in one smooth space.
- **Analogy**: Subway tracks (fibers) → terrain-based hiking (tensor curvature).
## 2. Typed Modes & Partial Tucker Graphs  
**Replaces**: Structured typing in discrete fibers
- **Concept**: Treat tensor modes as semantic types (e.g., affective, rhetorical), and apply partial Tucker decompositions over subsets.
- **Structure**: 
  - Tensor = field over $\mathcal{M}$
  - PTD on mode subset $S$ gives local projection
- **Advantage**: Modular views without predefined partitions.
- **Next step**: Define morphisms over modes = functorial mode logic.
## 3. Voronoi Dynamics as a Relevance Engine  
**Replaces**: Fiber-indexed relevance mechanisms

- **Concept**: Use Voronoi partitions and Delaunay graphs over tensor slices to generate dynamic coherence zones.
- **Use**:
  - Contradiction zones = high-tension ridge lines
  - Pseudo-Markov blankets = local coherence shells
- **Advantage**: Fast, spatially intuitive constraint navigation and backchaining.
## 4. Semantic Field as a Category  
**Replaces**: Fibration from $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$

- **Concept**: Treat semantic space $\mathcal{F}$ as a category:
  - **Objects**: Tensor configurations
  - **Morphisms**: Constraint-guided transformations (e.g., PTDs, deformations)
- **Extension**: Time becomes composition of morphisms.
- **Application**: UCSE as categorical engine; enables higher-level functorial design.
## 5. Closure as a Contradiction Singularity  
**Replaces**: Closure-as-type violation in fiber logic

- **Concept**: Define agent emergence through singularities in $R$:
  - High curvature + high entropy + low compatibility → closure point
- **Interpretation**: Agents as zones of unresolved contradiction.
- **Analogy**: A gravitational well in semantic space.
## 6. Teleological Flow Fields  
**Replaces**: Goal trees and local plan graphs

- **Concept**: Projected goals define a **teleological vector field** over the tensor space.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Vector field $T_{\text{goal}} : R \to R'$
  - Actions = inflections along projected curvature
- **Advantage**: Eliminates rigid planning structures in favour of fluid navigation.
## 7. Agent as Tensor Warp + Temporal Trace  
**Replaces**: Agent as indexed fiber entity

- **Concept**:
  - Warp: Persistent deformation in $R$ = current state of concern
  - Trace: Sequence of closures = semantic history
- **Outcome**: Agent is a **trajectory through curvature space**, not a static object.
