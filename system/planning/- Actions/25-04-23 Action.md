☐ Copy the YAML block from _Appendix A_ into `/spec/appendix-a_v2.yaml` so build-scripts can ingest it without markdown stripping.

☐ Add an Obsidian search/Dataview snippet:
    dataview
    CopyEdit

`TABLE file.name AS Note, regexmatch("PV[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+", file.content) AS Tags WHERE file.content =~ "⬡\\[PV"`
    → this surfaces every PV tag in the vault and flags orphaned ones visually.

☐ Move first diagram (Cone of Concern) into `/visual/` with the front-matter shown above.

☐ Once those four are ticked, both _Foundational Priors v2.0_ and _Appendix A v2.0_ are lint-clean and diagram-ready.

 Next Actions

☐ Integrate ⬡ PVS into all major theory documents  
☐ Move old “Pointer Validation” refs to Provenance Validation  
☐ Add version control notes for foundational priors  
☐ Create _PV Reference Doc_ (for collaborators and readers)  
☐ Build search/index tooling for PV tags (future)  

✅ Optional new PV tag for reprojection — not yet defined in the canonical list. You could add: ⬡[PV1.4]: Reprojection from belief space to semantic manifold.
