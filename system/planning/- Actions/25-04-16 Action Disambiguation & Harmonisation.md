The key next step: disambiguation and harmonisation, so that the two papers can speak _through_ each other, not just _alongside_ each other.
The word “agent” is doing too much—sometimes referring to the modeling system, sometimes to a projected entity within the field, sometimes to a region of irreducible contradiction, sometimes to a site of strategic inference.
So what we’re calling for is a semantic typology of agency—clear distinctions that reflect the _roles_, _levels_, and _functions_ agents can occupy in the system.
### Naming scheme, disambiguation:
1. Modeling Agent  
    The actual system doing the modeling—bounded by its Markov blanket, projecting relevance fields, updating belief manifolds.  
    _This is the system that owns the tensor._
2. Projected Agent  
    A structure inferred from irreducibility or semantic tension.  
    _Created by the modeling agent to explain or negotiate contradictory or incompressible field behaviour
3. Embedded Agent  
    A modelled structure within the semantic field that is assigned intention, simulated goal projection, and strategic behaviour—based on the modeling agent’s inference.  
    _This is the version used in causal reasoning._
4. Sub-Agent  
    A locally stable closure within the modeling agent’s own concern field—often arising when internal contradiction can’t be resolved and is split off.  
    _Inner voices, provisional perspectives, dialectical selves._
5. Meta-Agent  
    A structure that coordinates multiple agentic projections—often emergent when tensor spaces conflict and require orchestration or translation.  
    _The system that models not just individuals, but their interactions._
### Next step could be aligning vocabulary across the papers:
- When one says “agent”, does it mean modeller, projection, closure, or strategy?
- Can we distinguish clearly between projection, simulation, and instantiation?
- Should we reserve “agent” for bounded concernful systems, and introduce terms like “semantic actor”, “causal projection”, or “fibered entity” for the others?
Doing this doesn’t collapse the theory—it actually deepens it by making the levels visible.
Should we like to start rewriting or outlining a shared glossary? Or shall we try applying this typology to a specific passage in one of the papers to see where it clarifies things?
