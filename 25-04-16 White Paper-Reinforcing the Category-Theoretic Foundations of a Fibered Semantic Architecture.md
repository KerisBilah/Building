### Benjamin / 2025-04-16  
_This is a working document intended to crystallise recent developments in the categorical formalisation of the semantic field model. It outlines key shifts in structural thinking, with a focus on fibered representations, constraint satisfaction, and base space dynamics._
## 1. Introduction
This paper emerges from a desire to refine and reinforce the category-theoretic backbone of a model initially grounded in semantic field dynamics and constraint physics. Over time, the architecture has grown increasingly expressive—capable of modeling inference, metaphor, rhetorical tension, and discursive evolution. But much of that expressivity has remained pre-formal, scaffolded by metaphor rather than formal machinery.
Here we articulate a position: that category theory not only accommodates but clarifies the architectural commitments of the model. We focus especially on the emerging fibered conception of compositional meaning, and on how propositions—understood as constraint-resolved configurations—can warp, reinforce, or reshape the base tensor space of discourse.
## 2. Motivations for a Categorical Turn
The goal is not abstraction for its own sake. Rather, the categorical framework offers:
- Compositional clarity: tracking how local semantic fusions combine across interpretive chains.
- Structural control: defining clear compatibility regimes for propositions (via fiber typing).
- Scalable transformation: enabling functorial mappings between fuzzy spaces and stochastic inference structures.
- Formal expressibility: increasing the tractability of the model for mathematical interpretation, software modeling, or simulation.
## 3. Three Layers: Base, Fiber, and Fiber Type
To move toward formal coherence, we propose a three-tiered distinction:

| Layer      | Definition                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BaseTensor | A dynamic field encoding relevance geometry—shaped by accumulated constraints and argument saturation                                |
| Fiber      | local space of compositional possibility above a base point. Each fiber hosts propositions resolved through constraint satisfaction. |
| Fiber Type | A typing regime constraining what can compose within a given fiber (e.g., modality, rhetorical frame, temporal status).              |
This setup allows us to preserve:
- The local structure of propositional construction,
- The constraint-based dynamics of field evolution,
- The evolving curvature of the base (interpreted as effort, discourse phase, or epistemic saturation).
## 4. Constraint Satisfaction and Fiber Interaction

Constraint resolution is treated as a morphism within the fuzzy semantic category $\mathcal{F}$:
- Propositions emerge as resolved bundles of constraints (semantic vector fields),
- These reside within typed fibers, whose interaction space is restricted by compatibility schemas,
- Compatibility is not globally defined: it is indexed by fiber type, preventing incommensurate operations.

Thus, the architecture prevents category violations while allowing rich local interaction and cross-fiber influence via higher-order constraints.
## 5. Category Structure

### 5.1 Semantic Category $$\mathcal{F}$$
- Objects: Resolved semantic configurations (propositions as stabilised field bundles)
- Morphisms: Constraint-preserving transformations (fusion, metaphor, perspective shifts)
- Endofunctors: Cybernetic operators (e.g. amplification, attenuation) modulating the geometry of the field
- Fibered Structure: Each fiber is typed, and indexed over a base tensor that encodes relevance geometry and argumentative mass.

### 5.2 Stochastic Category $$\mathcal{B}$$
- Objects: Belief manifolds or inference-ready representations
- Morphisms: Bayesian updates, vector flows, transitions in argument structure
- Base Space: May encode *concern* or *teleological distance*—a goal-gradient shaped by prior belief adjustment and narrative motion
### 5.3 Functor $$F: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$$
- Translates constraint-resolved fields into probabilistic inference structures
- Preserves identity (unchanged propositions = no update)
- Preserves composition (fusion chains in $\mathcal{F}$ become inference chains in $\mathcal{B}$)
## 6. The Role of Memory and Feedback
We propose that fiber activity retroactively influences the base tensor, creating a dynamic feedback loop:
- Fiber → Base: Each proposition subtly deforms the base, increasing argumentative mass or coherence in certain regions.
- Base → Fiber: The base, in turn, governs which compositional trajectories are salient, relevant, or processable.

Memory is not a separate module—it is encoded in the curvature and density of the base tensor, as shaped by the historical accumulation of semantic work.
## 7. Where This Model Pushes Further
- The architecture resists one-size-fits-all compositionality. By typing fibers, we make space for incommensurable rhetorical or modal regimes.
- We retain topological expressiveness without symbolic reduction.
- Argumentation, interpretation, and belief evolve not as fixed paths, but as field deformations shaped by constraint satisfaction and teleological gradients.
## 8. Future Formalisation
Next steps may include:
- Defining a formal fibration or indexed category over relevance-geometric base spaces,
- Specifying the mapping conditions for typed fibers,
- Modeling cross-fiber interaction as a form of higher-order morphism or lifting problem,
- Implementing diagrams and simulations of discourse unfolding via fiber tension and resolution.
## 9. Concluding Note
This paper reflects a growing commitment: to shape a system that can model semantic life—its tensions, metaphors, arguments, and memory—not only descriptively, but formally. We believe that a category-theoretic framing, grounded in field theory and constraint dynamics, offers the right language for the job.
It does not discard intuition; it refines and preserves it, by giving it a scaffold capable of growth.
