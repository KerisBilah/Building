'Rewriting Do-Calculus: Toward a Topological Theory of Intervention in Belief Space' reformulates causal inference using topological and tensorial representations in belief space ùìë, integrating fuzzy modalities, agentive intervention, and the projection from semantic manifold ùìï.

'Before Belief ‚Äî Pre-Agentic Projection, Functorial Collapse, and the Birth of Belief' explores how belief and agency emerge from irreducible semantic tension in a fuzzy field. The module introduces the functorial projection F: ùìï to ùìë, pre-agentic teleology, and survival thresholds for belief emergence.

'Agency as Causal Primitive' defines agency as a warp-induced causal structure arising from contradiction in the semantic field ùìï. The theory distinguishes action from simulation and defines agents as irreducible semantic loci.

Belief space ùìë is a topological, stochastic field, the agent-level projection of the semantic field ùìï, representing structured commitments, inferences, and decision points. It is stochastic and inferential in nature, shaped by projection operators like the functor ùìí : ùìï ‚Üí ùìë and modulated by constraint satisfaction and rhetorical strategies.

The central projection operator ùìí : ùìï ‚Üí ùìë that collapses the fuzzy semantic manifold into agent-level belief space. This functor preserves structure, enabling inference, belief commitment, and causal tracing across the architecture.

The semantic manifold ùìï is a fuzzy, high-dimensional tensor field encoding meaning, tension, and interpretive constraint. Contradiction is represented as a deformation or compression failure in ùìï, and closure points in this field correspond to the emergence of agents or actions.

'Constraint as Rhetoric: On the Expressiveness of Resolution Strategies in Topological Semantic Systems'' introduces rhetorical priors as modular operators embedded in the constraint engine, which modulate semantic collapse and belief formation by shaping resolution strategies in a tensor-based architecture. The framework formalises a Constraint Morphism Stack (CMS), defined as a Prolog-style inference mechanism within the Tensor Resolution Layer (TRL), and integrates conceptual morphisms based on fuzzy star-shaped spaces to support geometrically informed resolution.

'Worlds ‚Äî Semantic Drift and Emergent Closure' paper describes how Semantic drift allows pre-agentive tensions to shape meaning before belief forms. Through rhetorical bias, affective deformation, and scaffolded rehearsal, these modulations evolve across five phases ‚Äî Drift, Bias, Competition, Chorus, Collapse ‚Äî eventually triggering closure and belief projection into B. The paper formalises how shared narrative traces and residual tension shape both agent formation and collective closure, while drift failures create a reusable semantic ecology for future activation.
