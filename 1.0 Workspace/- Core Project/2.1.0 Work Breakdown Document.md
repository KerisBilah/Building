### Phase 1: Ground the Formal Substrate 
#### (Weeks 1–2)
#### Goal:
Define the mathematical/structural foundation for your two-layer model.
#### Deliverables:
- Clear mathematical structures for:
    - Fuzzy Space (tensor field, constraint graph, etc.)
    - Stochastic Space (manifold of belief nodes)
- Formal specification for:
    - Fibers as semantic objects
    - Functorial Lift and Collapse (abstractly defined first)
- Select your representation formats
#### Questions to resolve:
- Will the fuzzy field be implemented as a constraint graph, a differentiable manifold, or both?
- How will you encode propositions structurally (triples? typed feature structures? category-theoretic morphisms? etc.)
### Phase 2: Build the Stochastic Layer 
#### (Weeks 3–5)
#### Goal:
Implement the Stochastic (Belief) Space as a probabilistic memory and inference layer.
#### Features:
- Nodes as belief objects (with probability, agentive vectors, relevance history)
- Connectivity rules for inference (causal, rhetorical, analogical)
- Temporal tagging or “momentum” tracking (to support relevance decay or activation bias)
#### Tooling:
- Use standard probabilistic graph frameworks (e.g., `pgmpy`, `networkx`, or `graph-tool`)
- Implement simple do-calculus operations (interventions, counterfactual re-weighting)
### Phase 3: Define Fuzzy Field Logic and Constraint Types 
#### (Weeks 5–8)
#### Goal:
Create the machinery for fuzzy constraint satisfaction in your high-dimensional field.
#### Elements:
- Semantic fibers = bundles of constraints over dimensions
- Constraint satisfaction = energy minimisation / coherence resolution
- Support for:
    - Perturbation / amplification
    - Relevance-weighted constraint priority
    - Soft constraints and partial violations
#### Recommended Frameworks:
- For prototyping: 
### Phase 4: Design the Lift–Synthesis–Collapse Cycle 
#### (Weeks 8–10)
#### Goal:
Operationalise the full loop:
1. Lift from stochastic to fuzzy space
2. Compose fibers and resolve constraints
3. Collapse into updated stochastic propositions
#### Core Methods:
- Define `lift()` and `collapse()` methods abstractly and then code them as functorial translations
- Ensure you support:
    - Mid-cycle latent field persistence
    - Multi-fiber composition and perturbation testing
    - Relevance-based attention over constraints
### Phase 5: Build Memory and Field Persistence Logic 
#### (Weeks 10–12)
#### Goal:
Implement long-term field behaviours:
- Persistence of latent fibers
- Priming
- Activation thresholds
- Cybernetic modulation (feedback loops)
#### Ideas to prototype:
- Energetic trace: decay functions on unresolved fibers
- Field memory: local topologies that carry forward interpretive tension
- Priming: activate old fibers based on feature overlap, rhetorical recurrence, or agentive echo
### Phase 6: Interface and Testing 
#### (Weeks 12–16)
#### Goal:
Design tools for interacting with the system and validating its behaviors.
#### Components:
- REPL-style console or notebook for feeding in propositions
- Visualization layer (e.g., dynamic graph of stochastic layer + fuzzy field maps)
- Test cases:
    - Metaphor resolution
    - Rhetorical ambiguity
    - Belief revision
    - Persistence of latent fields over cycles
## Tools to Consider
- Python for glue logic and constraint orchestration
- PyTorch or JAX if you want differentiable constraints or gradient-based energy minimization
- graph-tool or networkx for belief manifold
- Plotly, matplotlib, or PyVis for field/topology visualizations
## Long-Term Extensibility
Once the core is in place, you’ll be able to:
- Add a style engine (idiolect bundles + homotopies)
- Encode higher-order discourse structures (e.g., narrative arcs, metaphor fields)    
- Experiment with multi-agent dynamics (each agent has their own fuzzy field and belief space)
- Extend into embodied modalities (connect sensorimotor input as fuzzy constraints)
