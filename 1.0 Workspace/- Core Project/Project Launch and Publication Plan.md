# Project Launch and Publication Plan
title: Semantic Agency Architecture — Public Project Plan

priority: highest

## 1. Primary Goals
- Publicly release the theory, epistemology, and engineering components.
- Maintain permanent, citable records (DOIs) for each major paper.
- Invite participation while preserving architectural integrity.
- Tell the story of the system — its origin, its spirit, and its purpose.

## 2. Core Components
- **Theory Repository** (GitHub or GitLab)
  - Modular Markdown/LaTeX papers (Foundational Priors, UCSE, Agency as Causal Primitive, etc.)
  - Modular provenance validation tags (PV system).
- **Engineering Repository**
  - Rust codebase (UCSE Engine, Tensor Field Manager, etc.)
  - Engineering modular epistemology guide (how contributions are structured).
- **Documentation Site**
  - Lightweight Obsidian Publish site or MkDocs static site.
  - Hosted overview of theory, architecture, and entry points.
- **Artifact Archive**
  - Zenodo deposits (DOIs) for each major release version.
  - Versioned bundles: "Theory v1.0", "Engine v1.0", "Background Notes v1.0".

## 3. Publishing Steps
- Set up GitHub organization or repository: "semantic-agency-architecture"
- First commit: Foundational Priors v2.2 and Modular Epistemology guide.
- Parallel commits: Early UCSE skeleton (code and specification).
- After initial public version:
  - Archive release on Zenodo with clear metadata.
  - Generate DOI for citation and public record.
- Optional: Draft a "White Paper" summarizing the project purpose, for broad discovery.

## 4. Ethical and Philosophical Anchoring
- Manifesto-style "Origin and Intention" note.
- Emphasis on open agency, non-instrumental intelligences, and ethical field architectures.
- Clear invitation: "This project is an open conversation about the future of agency."

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
- Prepare a cleaned-up release bundle of:
  - Foundational Priors v2.2
  - Unified Constraint Satisfaction Engine
  - Modular Epistemology for Engineering Modules
- Establish GitHub/GitLab repository.
- Sketch first engineering "playground" in Rust (Tensor Field Playground).
