## Tags (Integration Type)

- Direct → Fits cleanly into a destination with little or no modification
- Synthesis Needed → Good idea but needs reworking, rewording, or combining
- Archive → Good idea, but no clear fit now — preserve for future use

## Status Tags

- Not Yet Processed → You've captured it but haven't decided yet
- Mapped → You've assigned it a destination
- Integrated → You've put it into its final place


## I. Audit Method

For each new proposed structure:

- Identify dependency: Which PV tags or formal objects does it touch?
- Compatibility check: Does it respect field structure, functoriality, closure logic, rhetorical priors?
- Risk rating:
    - ✅ Fully Compatible
    - ⚠️ Needs slight caution / future PV amendment
    - ❗ Potential violation (needs formal pre-approval)

## II. Individual Audits

### 1. Metaphysical Anchoring Operator $\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}$

 Definition: Logistic function of future relevance deformation vs projected contradiction.

- Touches:
    - $R$ (relevance field) ⬡PV1.1
    - $\Xi$ (contradiction tensor) ⬡PV1.2
    - Projection functor $\mathcal{C}$ ⬡PV1.3
- Check:
    - Operates locally in $\mathcal{F}$.
    - No violation of functorial closure projection — it's a diagnostic overlay, not a deformation.
    - Respects field continuity (logistic smoothing ensures no hard discontinuities).
- Risk: ✅ Fully Compatible

> Interpretive Note: Anchoring mass simply reads from existing field properties — it does not introduce new projection rules or mutate closure logic.

### 2. Agent Blanket Constructor $\mathcal{A}_{\text{sup}}$

 Definition: Field region where anchoring profiles overlap above a threshold.

- Touches:
    - $\mathcal{F}$ field topology ⬡PV1.1
    - Markov-style coverings (derived, not primary structures)
- Check:
    - Blanket formation operates in $\mathcal{F}$, not $\mathcal{B}$.
    - It constructs local envelopes without redefining closure events.
    - No risk to functorial projection or closure tension dynamics.
- Risk: ✅ Fully Compatible
    

> Interpretive Note: Agent blankets are _diagnostic constructs_ over anchoring fields, perfectly allowed within the topological continuous $\mathcal{F}$.

---

### 3. Residual Metric $\rho_{\text{meta}}$

 Definition: Integral over agent blanket of unanchored mass.

- Touches:
    - Anchoring operator (dependent on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}$)
    - Markov blanket induced zones (computational, not foundational)
- Check:
    - This metric does not modify field dynamics or closure logic.
    - It reads a differential feature (irreducibility residue) inside an already defined closure zone.

- Risk: ✅ Fully Compatible
    

> Interpretive Note: No foundational risk because $\rho_{\text{meta}}$ is purely a second-order measurement, not a structural modifier.

### 4. Affective Modulation Kernel $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$

 Definition: Local field operator biasing relevance gradients or curvature.

- Touches:
    - Relevance field $R$ ⬡PV1.1
    - Contradiction tensor $\Xi$ ⬡PV1.2
    - Teleological field $\phi$ (affective drift)
        
- Check:
    - Treated as pre-closure modulation (before closure or projection).
    - Fits under rhetorical priors (biasing constraint flows, ⬡PV3.1).
    - No breakage of functoriality or closure condition.

- Risk: ✅ Fully Compatible

> Interpretive Note: Affective modulation is structurally identical to a soft rhetorical prior $\pi_k$, just operating at the field-tensor level instead of constraint-grammar level.

### 5. Cone of Concern $\mathcal{K}_x$

 Definition: Derived operational envelope in $\mathcal{F}$ based on $R$, $\phi$, and $\kappa$.

- Touches:
    - Relevance $R$, Teleology $\phi$, Curvature $\kappa$ ⬡PV2.1
    - Closure tension threshold ⬡PV2.2 (indirectly, via emergent actionability)

- Check:
    - Fully a derived structure, not imposed.
    - Formed by interpreting field gradients, not by adding closure triggers or new projection rules.
    - Explicitly affirmed in PV structure (e.g., §1.5 says cone-of-concern is derived).

- Risk: ✅ Fully Compatible

> Interpretive Note: The cone $\mathcal{K}_x$ is in fact required by PV2.1 to model bounded semantic action.

## III. Overall Summary

|Structure|Status|Reason|
|---|---|---|
|$\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}$|✅ Fully Compatible|Pure diagnostic, no mutation|
|$\mathcal{A}_{\text{sup}}$|✅ Fully Compatible|Derived topological covering|
|$\rho_{\text{meta}}$|✅ Fully Compatible|Residual measurement only|
|$\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$|✅ Fully Compatible|Fits rhetorical prior model|
|$\mathcal{K}_x$|✅ Fully Compatible|Explicitly called for by PV2.1|

# Conclusion

There are no contradictions between the new insertions and Foundational Priors v2.2.
- No breakage of functoriality.
- No closure condition violation.
- No rhetorical modulation inconsistency.
- No semantic discontinuities in $\mathcal{F}$ or $\mathcal{B}$.

These structures can proceed to integration — after a quick PV-tagging assignment to trace their formal insertions.
