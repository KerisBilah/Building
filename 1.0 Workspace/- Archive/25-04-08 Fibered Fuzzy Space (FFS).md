The fuzzy space provides a high-dimensional topology of meaning, structured by tensor-based composition. The stochastic space performs dimensional reduction—but not as pure compression. Instead, it acts as a selective lens: emphasising the actionable, the predictable, the structurally resolved, while preserving essential traces of origin. And this is where the fiber representation becomes so powerful.

Each fiber contains the local instantiation of a proposition or concept within a broader base of meaning. And the functor between spaces doesn’t just map objects—it preserves the essential _orientation_ of elocutionary vectors. The vector of actor, patient, effect—these are not just features, but _trajectories_, encoded in the way propositions unfold, interact, and influence expectations.
