#### ⚠️ Scope Clarification
While many of the mechanisms described here share deep structural affinity with **agentic inference systems**—particularly in their use of constraint fields, closure dynamics, and tensorial modulation—this document is **not** about agency per se.

Instead, we focus on the **semantic substrate**:
- A shared field of compositional meaning  
- Governed by fuzzy compatibility, rhetorical curvature, and constraint-driven fusion  
- Where closure is not owned but **emergent**, provisional, and intersubjectively maintained.

**By contrast**, agentic systems introduce:
- Individuated concern tensors
- Projected patient-hood
- Recursive modeling of other agents
- And teleological binding across nested structures

Those elements will be treated separately in the companion work:

> **Towards Agentic Ecology: Concern Tensors and Individuated Fields** *(forthcoming)*

This division allows us to isolate the **shared compositional geometry** of semantic space before reintroducing the asymmetries of agent-centred projection.

These closures:
- Bind local inference,
- Protect against irrelevant perturbation,
- Enable agentive projection,
- And—when they fail—generate zones of contradiction and rhetorical drift.

#### Topics to Explore  
- How closure behaves dynamically under constraint warping  
- When and why propositions fail to resolve (and what happens next)  
- The role of endofunctorial modulation in reshaping closure boundaries  
- Active inference as field probing: projection into near-future relevance  
- The re-projection of failed closure zones into the stochastic layer  
- Genealogical drift and rhetorical recycling of unresolved content  

#### Relation to Existing Work  
- Builds on: *Unified Constraint System*, *Prior Flow Update*, *Material Tensor Argumentation*.  
- Integrates: agency individuation, rhetorical concern, constraint thermodynamics.  
- Opens: a research path into “semantic ecology”—an active, living space of tension, fusion, failure, and conceptual evolution.
