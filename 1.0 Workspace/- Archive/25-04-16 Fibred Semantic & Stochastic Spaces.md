## 25-04-16 Fibred Semantic & Stochastic Spaces

### A Paired Description with Notes on Structure and Interpretation

_This document provides updated characterisations of two key spaces in the model: the Fibred Fuzzy (Semantic) Space and the Fibred Stochastic (Belief) Space. These are defined relationally, not in isolation. Each inherits structure from the other through a functorial interface, and each plays a different role in shaping meaning, memory, and inference._
## I. Fibred Fuzzy Space
### Short Description:
The Fibred Fuzzy Space is a high-dimensional, constraint-responsive semantic manifold. Each point in the base relevance tensor corresponds to a local field of compositional possibility: a fiber of semantically typed constraints and candidate propositions.
- Fibers are typed: they encode allowable modes of composition (e.g. metaphor, causal explanation, evidential fusion).
- Constraint satisfaction unfolds within each fiber, producing resolved propositions (field bundles).
- These propositions retroactively shape the base tensor, increasing curvature or density in regions of high argumentative reinforcement.
- The space is "fuzzy" in the sense that meanings are not fixed values but evolving configurations, tension-minimising states within a tensorially warped field.
### Baggage / Open Issues:
- The exact distinction between tensor structure and fiber dimensionality is still being refined. Fibers carry constraints and vector fields, but how this interplays with the base curvature is context-sensitive.
- Treating fibers as memory loci implies some bidirectional influence, which complicates classical fiber bundle assumptions.
- How cross-fiber composition occurs (e.g. between a metaphor and a causal proposition) is managed via higher-order constraints, but could benefit from a sheaf-theoretic formalism.
## II. Fibred Stochastic Space
### Short Description:
The Fibred Stochastic Space is a reduced, probabilistic manifold of belief and inference. It encodes collapsed propositions from the fuzzy space—propositions that have stabilised enough to serve as inferential anchors, predictive structures, or memory units.
- Each fiber represents a belief configuration indexed over a point in a concern-based base space—which encodes teleological proximity, relevance gradients, or cognitive cost.
- Propositions are mapped into this space via a structure-preserving functor from $\mathcal{F}$ (semantic category) to $\mathcal{B}$ (belief category).
- Inference unfolds within this space via vector flows, Bayesian updates, or topological rearrangement of the manifold.
- These belief states may, in turn, prime or reactivate fibers in the fuzzy space during interpretive loops.
### Baggage / Open Issues:
- The nature of the base space here (concern, goal-distance, relevance) is dynamic and may itself be shaped by memory and belief—raising the question of whether it is a true “base” or a co-evolving field.
- Memory is modelled as directional trace information across belief transitions, but this is still formalised.
- Fiber typing in this space is less well-defined: do different kinds of belief structures require separate fiber regimes, or are all beliefs embedded in a single global topology?
## III. Relational Note
These two spaces are not separable ontologies—they form a bidirectional interpretive ecology. Propositions move from the fuzzy space into the stochastic space through constraint resolution, and then influence future semantic construction through priming, memory traces, and concern-based shaping of the base.
We propose that:
- A functor $$F: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$$ governs the mapping of resolved propositions into the belief manifold,
- Feedback from $\mathcal{B}$ to $\mathcal{F}$ is mediated through tensorial curvature, cybernetic modulation, and fiber reactivation.
This document defines the components; a separate document will explore formal models of their relationship.
