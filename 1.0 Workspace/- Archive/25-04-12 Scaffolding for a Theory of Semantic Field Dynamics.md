>"What is this thing you’re building about, made of, and for ?"

This is a pre-formal design sketch, or a pre-axiomatic field manual.
### Define the Ontological Commitments

> "What are the things  the theory deals with?"

This theory does not begin with discrete symbols or pre-labelled parts of speech. Instead, it posits a set of ontological primitives that are processual, emergent, and  field-based.
1. Semantic Points
	- These are  not tokens or words, but  emergent positions  in a dynamic field.
	- They become “visible” when constraints stabilise into a  locally coherent configuration.
	- Analogous to  morphogenetic centres  in biological development—they don’t exist until tensions resolve into shape.
2. The Field
	- A  continuously deformable, multidimensional space.
	- It contains  latent dimensions  (agentivity, modality, affect, etc.) that are only activated under constraint.
	- Think of it as a  semantic potential space, like an energy field in physics, but shaped by linguistic, cognitive, and social forces.
3. Propositions
	- Not fixed meanings or truth-bearers.
	- Each proposition is a  bundle of interacting constraints —a kind of  semantic force vector  entering the field.
	- They reshape the field by stretching, carving, or stabilising certain regions.
4.  Dimensions
	- These are  not fixed axes, but  potential directions of differentiation.
	- They remain dormant unless  activated by constraint interaction.
	- Examples: animacy, intentionality, scalarity, affect, embodiment.
5. Constraints
	- The core operators of the system.
	- Constraints define  local conditions  for compatibility, coherence, and relevance.
	- They may encode:
	    - Syntactic restrictions,
	    - Semantic roles,
	    - Pragmatic expectations,
	    - World knowledge.
 Key Insight : Meaning is  not  encoded in linguistic units—it emerges as a  field event, shaped by the interaction of constraints across a warped semantic space.
### Define the Dynamic Principles

> "How does the space evolve?"

1. Constraint Satisfaction
	- The field is always seeking a configuration that  minimises violation  of all active constraints.
	- New propositions introduce  perturbations —temporary tensions that must be resolved across the field.
	- Satisfaction is  non-binary : constraints can be partially satisfied or balanced.
2. Relevance Warping
	- Following  Sperber & Wilson, relevance is defined in terms of  inferential yield  vs.  processing effort.
	- In this model, relevance dynamically  warps the geometry of the field :
	    - Relevant dimensions are stretched (more finely resolved),
	    - Irrelevant ones are collapsed or backgrounded.
	- This creates  context-sensitive curvature  in the semantic landscape.
3. Inertial Stabilisation
	- Prior discourse and shared knowledge generate  field momentum.
	- This makes the field  resistant to abrupt shifts, unless:
	    - Relevance is very high,
	    - Or contradiction accumulates.
	- This is how  coherence  and  discourse continuity  are maintained over time.
4. Interpretive Tension
	- Ambiguity, metaphor, or contradiction introduces  local energy  into the field.
	- The field doesn’t fail—it  tenses, and meaning emerges through  realignment.
	- Some propositions intentionally raise tension (e.g., jokes, irony) and then resolve it for cognitive effect.
5. Topology of Compatibility
	- Semantic coherence is not about matching inputs to templates.
	- Instead, it arises from  aligning multiple constraint surfaces  so they intersect in a compatible zone.
	- Transformations (like metaphor or frame-shifting) are  topological operations, not symbol replacements.

  Key Insight : The field is not passively shaped—it actively resists, redirects, and reorganises meaning through forces analogous to physical tension, inertia, and curvature.
### Identify the Types of Constraints

> "What are the primitive forces in this space?"

Each constraint is a kind of  semantic vector field, shaping the local geometry of interpretation. Here are foundational classes:
1. Semantic Selection
	- E.g., "drink" prefers liquid nouns.
	- These constraints reflect  typical co-occurrence patterns  and  conceptual affordances.
2. Pragmatic Expectations
	- Based on context, speaker goals, and social norms.
	- E.g., "It's cold in here" in some contexts implies a request.
3. Logical Compatibility
	- Some constraints are  logical or scalar : e.g., "only" + "many" implies a contradiction or tension.
4. Domain Activation
	- The field may shift to  instantiate specific ontological domains :
	    - Physical space,
	    - Social interaction,
	    - Internal states.
    - These domains pull certain dimensions forward while backgrounding others.
5. Metonymic Shifts
	- A constraint that allows partial mappings between domains:
	    - E.g., "The White House issued a statement" uses  institution-for-agent  substitution.
6. Prototype Gravity
	- Frequently used meanings become  attractors —regions of low-energy, high-coherence interpretation.
	- They make nearby interpretations easier to stabilise.

 Key Insight : Constraints are local expressions of structured knowledge. They interact globally across the field to produce emergent semantic configurations.
###  Explain How Meaning Emerges

> What does it mean for a proposition to “have meaning” in this framework?

1. Meaning ≠ Symbol
	- A proposition has no intrinsic meaning.
	- Instead, it  modulates the field  through the propagation of constraints.
2. A proposition “means something” when:
	- Its constraints enter the field and interact with existing structure.
	- The field  reconfigures  itself to accommodate them.
	- A  stable (or metastable) configuration  is reached where:
	    - Contradictions are minimised,
	    - Compatibility zones are formed,
	    - Salience is locally optimised.
####  Example:
 “The argument collapsed under pressure.” 

- Initially produces high interpretive tension:
    - “Argument” is abstract,
    - “Collapse” suggests physical structure.
- The field explores  topological transformations  (e.g., metaphor mappings).
- Stabilises when a structural metaphor is invoked—“arguments as edifices.”
- Constraints resolve into a coherent region:
    - Agent = opposing forces,
    - Effect = argument failure under scrutiny.

  Key Insight : Meaning is  a local minimum in the constraint landscape —an area of reduced tension where conflicting forces have temporarily resolved..
### Define the Theoretical Payoff

> What does this framework allow us to  see  that others can’t?

The semantic field dynamics framework allows us to:
1. Model Ambiguity and Metaphor Without Breaking the System
	- These aren’t exceptions—they are  normal results  of overlapping, stretching, and warping constraint fields.
2. Diagnose Miscommunication
	- Misunderstanding isn’t failure—it’s a  mismatch of constraint systems  (e.g. speaker and listener operate in different warped fields).
3. Handle Context Dynamically
	- Instead of rigid templates or stored scripts, context shifts the  shape of the semantic field, enabling fluid adaptation.
4. Track Meaning Over Time
	- Meaning is  temporal, shaped over a trajectory of propositions.
	- This framework supports a  dynamical trace —the narrative unfolding of meaning.
5. Connect to Embodied, Material Metaphors
	- By grounding field dynamics in  material science, topology, and physics, we gain tools for analysing not just what a sentence “says” but how it  acts —as a physical intervention in a meaning space.

 Key Insight : Semantic field dynamics gives us a  computational semantics of lived experience —flexible, dynamic, and sensitive to relevance, context, and contradiction.
