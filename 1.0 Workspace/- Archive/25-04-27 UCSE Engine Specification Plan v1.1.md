## 1.1 Motivating Constraints
⬡[PV-E0.1]

- Must operate seamlessly across $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{B}$.
- Requires partial decomposability (PTD) to maintain responsiveness under semantic load.
- Prioritises runtime efficiency, auditability, and symbolic coherence with constraint morphisms.
- Must support scaffolded closures and smooth promotion logic for real-time belief update modeling.
- Engineering output must be externally traceable and compatible with archaeological visualization.

## 1.2 Implicit Design Questions

- How do we balance expressive PTD decomposition with computational efficiency?
- What structure should mode-selection policies have to remain interpretable and adaptive?
- How do we design constraint re-injection without violating field curvature or symbolic coherence?
- Can belief projection remain functorial even under local approximations?

## 1.3 Formal Engineering Structure

Modules:
- `PTD Engine` — accepts high-rank tensors and applies selective mode decompositions.
- `Tension Aggregator` — computes $\mathcal{T}_{\text{local}}$ and promotes scaffolds.
- `Scaffold Layer` — manages provisional closures ($\Omega_s$), promotion tracking.
- `Projection Layer` — functorial map $\mathcal{C} : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ + trace encoding.
- `Trace Logger` — extracts $\tau$, PTD residuals, semantic ridge lines for visualisation.

Interfaces:
- All modules expose MVTs (Minimal Viable Traces) and support external render auditing.
- Tensor interfaces typed over modes and decomposition format.

## 1.4 Expansion Pathways and Approximation Windows

- Future module: Dynamic Mode Selector  
  Enables adaptive mode subset selection for PTD based on local semantic pressure and rhetorical fatigue.

- Approximation Window:  
  Where exact low-rank PTD is computationally infeasible, a rank-approximation window (e.g., within ε-residual) is permitted.  
  All such cases must:
  - Declare residual size
  - Scaffold incomplete decomposition
  - Log the affected region ID in $\mathcal{F}$

- Reversible Scaffolds:  
  All scaffolded regions ($\Omega_s$) must preserve trace history to allow re-entry for later recomputation or belief upgrade.

## 1.5 Invariant Preservation and Field Integrity

The following invariants must be preserved:

- Topological continuity of belief space $\mathcal{B}$  
  Projection operations must preserve connectedness and curvature unless explicitly scaffolded.

- Functorial projection trace:  
  $\mathcal{C}: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ must maintain morphism structure or log divergence via symbolic tags.

- Contradiction residual field $\Xi$ must remain decomposable:  
  No module may overwrite or mute contradiction fields without trace scaffolding.

- Agentive alignment coherence:  
  Any update to warp trace fields $(\gamma, \tau, \phi)$ must preserve semantic correspondence to $\mathcal{F}$ slices.

## 1.6 Perturbation and Sensitivity Mapping


| Component | Perturbation | Risk | Recovery Strategy |
|----------|---------------|------|-------------------|
| PTD Engine | Failed decomposition | Local contradiction undetected | Re-enter scaffolded cycle |
| Tension Aggregator | Inaccurate $\mathcal{T}_{\text{local}}$ | Premature closure or missed promotion | Trigger constraint backflow |
| Projection Layer | Broken $\mathcal{C}$ functor | Belief trace misaligned | Flag for reprojection with $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ |
| Trace Logger | τ or ridge omitted | Diagnostic loss | Archive scaffolded region for later replay |

All modules must emit diagnostic traces enabling reconstruction of state under failure.

## 1.7 Technology and Stack Mapping


Primary Language: Rust (for speed, memory safety, composability)  
- Tensor algebra: `ndarray`, `nalgebra`, or custom Rust bindings to `eigen`/`lapack`  
- Constraint engine: custom module, inspired by Prolog-style inference  
- Visualisation: external trace renderer via SageMath + Mermaid + Graphviz  
- Trace logging: JSON + Markdown, decoupled from runtime  
- Testing: `cargo test`, integrated with trace validation and PV logging hooks  
- Symbolic scaffolding: macro system to scaffold divergences, promote rollback, and maintain symbolic logs

Toolchain rationale:  
Rust enables zero-cost abstraction with strong compile-time guarantees.  
Trace layer and rendering tools are externalised for auditability and minimal runtime interference.


## 1.8 Known Risks and Trade-offs


| Risk | Cause | Potential Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----|------|------------------|---------------------|
| PTD Failure | Tensor too incoherent or noisy | Incomplete closure cycles | Scaffold local failure, allow gradual recompression |
| Trace Drift | Poor logging of τ or scaffold IDs | Diagnostic invisibility | Mandatory MVT (Minimal Viable Trace) logging |
| Functorial Breakage | Approximate projections | Loss of topological coherence | Detect and scaffold divergence; externalize projections for validation |
| Resource Saturation | High-dimensional PTD + geometry projections | Latency spikes | Adjustable complexity thresholds; progressive refinement of scaffold regions |

Explicit declaration of trade-offs:

- No guarantee of total closure: UCSE operates continuously; closure may roll across cycles.
- Explicitly non-reliant on symbolic truth: UCSE's dynamics are field-theoretic and relational.
- Field projection ≠ graph commitment: Voronoi/Delaunay partitions are heuristic guides, not primary structures.

## 1.9 Toolchain-Specific Audit Hooks


- Tensor Operations Audit:  
  All tensor decompositions (PTD) must emit residuals, ranks, and selected modes into structured logs.

- Constraint Activations Audit:  
  Each constraint-firing cycle must timestamp active bundles, fired constraints, and local contradiction indicators.

- Projection and Reprojection Audit:  
  Each functorial projection $\mathcal{C}$ and re-projection $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ must log its domain, codomain, and whether symbolic coherence was preserved.

- Scaffold Promotions Audit:  
  Every promotion from $\Omega_s$ (scaffolded region) to stable closure must emit a semantic tension snapshot.

## 1.10 Visualization and Trace Rendering


- Visualization outputs must be read-only and external to runtime operations.
- Primary formats:
  - Tensor field curvature plots (SageMath)
  - Scaffold and closure maps (Voronoi partition overlays)
  - Scaffold promotion timelines (Mermaid flowcharts)
  - Warp trace $(\gamma, \tau, \phi)$ visualizations (Graphviz DAGs)

- Visualizations must:
  - Be reconstructible purely from MVT logs
  - Not affect runtime behavior or internal tensor states
  - Support “archaeological audit” (post-hoc, non-invasive diagnostics)

## 1.11 Constraint Fidelity and Symbolic Coherence


- Projection functor $\mathcal{C}$ must preserve morphism structure.  
  If not, all approximations must be:
  - Scaffolded
  - Logged
  - Reversible when possible

- PTD reductions must record rank loss as a divergence metric.

- Warp traces $(\gamma, \tau, \phi)$ must maintain semantic continuity:  
  No fracture of trace continuity is permitted without fallback scaffolding.

Symbolic Coherence Levels:

| Morphism | Fidelity | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| $\mathcal{C}: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ | Must be functorial or scaffolded | |
| $\text{PTD}_S: T \to G$ | Approximate permitted with rank-residual logs | |
| $\gamma, \tau, \phi$ field evolution | Continuous; scaffold on warp fracture | |


## 1.12 AI-Assisted Component Tracking


| Component | AI Involvement | Status | Review Requirement |
|-----------|----------------|--------|--------------------|
| Tensor decomposition strategy hints | Suggestive only | Experimental | Human approval required |
| Visualization layout proposals | Suggestive only | Provisional | Editable; human approval mandatory |
| Local scaffold promotion criteria | Permissive but human-supervised | Provisional | Annotated with rationale |

No AI component may:
- Commit runtime-affecting transformations without explicit human checkpoint.
- Omit meta-log describing generation context and intended use.


## 1.13.1–1.13.4 AI Meta-Logging and Audit Symmetry

1.13.1 Meta-Logging of AI Contributions
- Each AI-suggested artefact must carry a meta-log including:
  - Prompt snapshot
  - Intended semantic function
  - Confirmation of human review

1.13.2 AI Perturbation Watchdogs
- AI may propose early detection of:
  - Divergence in $\mathcal{C}$ mappings
  - Scaffold instabilities
  - Tension spike anomalies
- However, AI may not correct autonomously — only flag.

1.13.3 Visual Trace Audit Hooks
- AI may assist by proposing visualisation overlays or tension summaries.
- All such outputs must be logged externally without runtime alteration.

1.13.4 Audit Symmetry
- AI-generated components are held to identical provenance and trace standards as human-generated artefacts.
- No "hidden" generation or unlogged optimisation is permitted.

## 1.14 Module Status Gradation


| Status       | Criteria                                                      | Current Status                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Experimental | Motivating constraints + partial formal structure present     | ✅                                         |
| Provisional  | Full structure + partial validation of perturbations and MVTs | (Target after prototyping PTD + scaffold) |
| Canonical    | Full PV compliance, external audit readiness                  | (Planned post-simulation)                 |

> Graduation Notes:
> - UCSE Engine is currently in Experimental phase.
> - Provisional graduation planned after first successful tensor decomposition + scaffold validation in Rust prototype.
> - Canonical graduation contingent on full PV satisfaction (including MVT, symbolic coherence, and perturbation sensitivity).

## 1.15 Tooling Flexibility with Interface Discipline


- Primary Implementation Language: Rust
  - Tensor engine in Rust (high performance, safe concurrency)
  - SageMath modules for visualization and symbolic prototyping
  - Cargo-based test pipelines

- Flexibility Clauses:
  - Local experimentations in Jupyter (Python/SageMath) permitted.
  - C/C++ wrappers allowed for extremely low-level optimizations (e.g., tensor libraries) if MVT logging preserved.

- Interface Discipline:
  - All modules must emit declared MVTs (Minimal Viable Traces).
  - Interfaces must remain auditable regardless of implementation tool.

Example:
- PTD module must expose: input tensor metadata, mode selections, residuals, output tensor metadata.
- Constraint cycle must expose: constraint triggers, residual tensions, closure attempt outcomes.


## 1.16 Recommended Toolchain Standards


| Category | Recommended Tool / Practice |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Version Control | Git (Conventional Commits) |
| Testing | Rust `cargo test`, SageMath notebook asserts |
| Documentation | Markdown-first with embedded PV codes |
| Visualization | SageMath, Graphviz, Mermaid |
| Trace Logging | Plaintext or JSON external logs |

All traces must support:
- Archaeological reconstruction (post-hoc)
- Non-intrusive runtime behaviour
- Toolchain-agnostic export

## 1.17 Realistic AI Collaboration Protocols

AI may assist in:

- Rapid prototyping (e.g., PTD mode set suggestions, scaffold promotion heuristics)
- Visualization scaffolding
- Risk mapping suggestions

However:
- AI cannot autonomously modify runtime dynamics.
- AI contributions must be meta-logged, human-reviewed, and non-critical until validated.
- No speculative or "silent" optimisations without external traceability and rollback scaffolds.

## 1.18 Linking Supplemental Standards to PV Codes


| Section | PV Supported | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| 1.14 Module Status Gradation | ⬡PV-E0.1 | Enables gradual validation maturity |
| 1.15 Tooling Flexibility with Interface Discipline | ⬡PV-E2.x, ⬡PV-E8.x | Preserves auditability across environments |
| 1.16 Recommended Toolchain Standards | ⬡PV-E8.x, ⬡PV-E9.x | Consistent external traces |
| 1.17 Realistic AI Collaboration Protocols | ⬡PV-E11.x | Protects traceability of AI influence |

Thus, all supplemental engineering practices reinforce the core PV audit architecture without requiring expansion of PV codebase.
