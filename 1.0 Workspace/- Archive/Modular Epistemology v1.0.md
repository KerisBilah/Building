# Modular Epistemology v1.0

> *Internal architectural logic for the semantic agency framework.*  
> *Last revised: April 2025*
## Overview

This document formalises a modular, auditable structure for epistemic and architectural claims. It defines a system of Provenance Validation ⬡[PVx.y] — a tag-based architecture for structural coherence, shared dependencies, and inter-document integrity.

This system is not just for tracing where claims come from. It is designed to:

- Modularise epistemic structures
- Validate formal and conceptual moves against shared assumptions
- Support reuse and integration across theoretical domains

The architecture assumes documents will evolve — this schema ensures they evolve coherently.

### Core Mechanics Recap

PV Tags (e.g., ⬡[PV2.1]) are inserted wherever a theoretical or formal claim depends on a defined structural assumption.

Each tag anchors a claim to:
- A formal object (e.g., $\mathcal{C}$, $\Xi$),
- A constraint logic (e.g., closure thresholding),
- Or a rhetorical mechanism (e.g., morphism stack behaviour).

These tags are global, meaning they carry the same meaning wherever used — even across documents.

### Inter-Document Validation

You’re absolutely right: ⬡PV tags don’t just connect documents — they validate that claims made in _any_ document comply with shared foundational assumptions. For example:

- The cone of concern’s use of $R$, $\phi$, and $\kappa$ ⬡[PV2.1] ensures it aligns with the formal structure of concern geometry.
- If you redefine $\phi$ as a dynamic instead of static vector field, you’ll need to revalidate all ⬡[PV2.1] references — and the validation schema gives you a structured checklist to do so.

### Conventions + Inspiration

This isn’t yet a widespread public convention, but it draws on analogues from:

- Type systems and refinement types
- Software contract systems
- Category theory with identity-preserving morphisms
- Ontology versioning in knowledge representation

## 1. Structural Template for Theory Modules

Your documents typically follow this architecture:

### 1.0.1 PV Conformance Checklist for Structural Template

| Section                  | Structural Role        | PV Compliance Required                       | Confirmed |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1.1 Motivating Intuition | Conceptual anchoring   | ⬡[PV0.1] (no formal dependency)              |           |
| 1.2 Implicit Questions   | Diagnostic map         | ⬡[PV1.x], ⬡[PV2.x] (forward reference only)  |           |
| 1.3 Formal Structure     | Math/logic definitions | Must cite ⬡[PV1.x, PV2.x] objects            |           |
| 1.4 What This Elucidates | Interpretive function  | ⬡[PV3.x], ⬡[PV4.x] (modulation and geometry) |           |
| 1.5 Background           | Dependency trace       | Must link to ⬡[PV1.x–PV2.x] assumptions      |           |
| 1.6 Formal Dependencies  | PV audit targets       | Explicit PV tags ⬡[PVx.y] required           |           |
| 1.7 Sensitivity Mapping  | Perturbation impact    | Must use PV tags to diagnose fragility       |           |

### 1.1 Motivating Intuition

A reader-accessible entry: poses a conceptual, felt, or operational problem.
- _Why this section exists:_ To make the formal problem recognisable as a situated, human issue.
- _Validation implication:_ ⬡[PV0.1] This section needs no validation — but it defines the "semantic task" the model addresses.

### 1.2 Implicit Questions

Surfaces the latent interrogatives in the intuition. A diagnostic table of what must be answered.
- _Role:_ To orient what must be _elucidated_ or formalised.
- _Often links forward to:_ ⬡[PV1.x] (object-level constructs), ⬡[PV2.x] (closure & constraint).

Example:


| Question                                                    | Why it matters                                      | Linked PV          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Q1. How does semantic tension survive without agents?       | Frames pre-agentic field as coherent, not noise.    | ⬡[PV1.5]           |
| Q2. What structures survive compression into belief?        | Identifies conditions for functorial collapse.      | ⬡[PV1.3], ⬡[PV2.2] |
| Q3. How is ownership of meaning triggered?                  | Sets thresholds for agency and closure.             | ⬡[PV2.2]           |
| Q4. How do triadic projections emerge from survival events? | Ground for agent, addressee, and subject.           | ⬡[PV4.2]           |
| Q5. Why is survival not mere compression?                   | Distinguishes agentive formation from passive loss. | ⬡[PV1.2], ⬡[PV3.1] |


### 1.3 Formal Structure

Introduces math or formal tools.
- _This is the declarative layer._
- All formal objects, mappings, conditions, and spaces must trace to a shared validation scheme ⬡[PVx.y].

### 1.4 What This Elucidates

A functional/explanatory pass. How does the formalism answer the implicit questions?
- _Supports interpretability, not just validity._
- Often includes heuristic insights or cybernetic interpretations.  
- _Validation:_ ⬡[PV3.x] rhetorical priors, ⬡[PV4.x] interpretive geometry.

### 1.5 Background

Establishes the dependency trace. Connects this module to:
- Prior mathematical definitions
- Architectural principles
- Foundational Priors (⬡[PV1.x])
- Closure and constraint assumptions (⬡[PV2.x])

### 1.6 Formal Dependencies

A section that explicitly traces the foundational claims a module depends on (PV-tagged). This supports:
- Local validation against ⬡[PVx.y]
- Re-audit planning if assumptions shift
- Integration with architectural assumption layers

### 1.7 Sensitivity and Perturbation Mapping

This formalises the sensitivity table you've been using. It answers:
- What happens if this part changes?
- Which downstream modules break or require revision?

## 2. Provenance Validation System (PVS)

### 2.1 What Is a PV?

A PV (Provenance Validation) entry:

- Declares: “This clause relies on specific foundational assumptions.”
- Anchors: a formal, rhetorical, or interpretive move.
- Connects: across documents, validating structural consistency.

Use the symbol `⬡` inline with `[PVx.y]` to flag it.

> _Example:_  
> “The cone of concern is defined as the bounded region over $\mathcal{F}$ conditioned by $\phi$, $R$, and $\kappa$ ⬡[PV2.1].”

This points to the closure logic dependency: PV2.1.

### 2.2 Why the PV tags look like `⬡[PV1.3]`

(and what that means inside Obsidian)

|Glyph|What it is|Why we chose it|What Obsidian does with it|
|---|---|---|---|
|`⬡`|A purely decorative “PV bullet” (hexagon)|Makes the tag visually pop & grep-able. It has no syntax role.|Treated as an ordinary Unicode character.|
|`[PV1.3]`|A square-bracket wrapper around the provenance code|1 ≈ Minimal markup that is unlikely to collide with LaTeX `$…$` or Obsidian `[[…]]` links.  <br>2 ≈ Keeps the tag _inside_ normal paragraph flow (no hashtags or code-fences needed).|By default Obsidian treats single-`[` … `]` as plain text (unlike `[[wikilink]]`). Nothing special happens unless you add a community plug-in or custom CSS.|

### 2.3  Why not use `[[PV1.3]]` (double brackets) ?

- `[[…]]` is a wikilink in Obsidian; clicking opens (or creates) a note with that exact name.  
    – That’s great for concept notes, but here we want the tag to remain internal to the sentence rather than navigate away.
- We will already be using real wikilinks like `[[Cone of Concern]]`.  
    The provenance tag should be visually distinct so readers don’t expect it to jump to another note.

### 2.4  What extra functionality can we get?

Nothing “extra” out-of-the-box—but that’s by design:

1. Search / Dataview
    - `CTRL/⌘ + F` or use Obsidian’s global search for `⬡[PV2.2]` to see every clause that relies on that assumption.
    - Dataview queries can grep notes for the pattern `/⬡\[PV2\.2\]/` and build automatic dependency indexes.
        
2. Custom CSS
    `/* Give PV tags a light yellow pill-background */ span.pv-tag {    background:#FFF8CC;   padding:0 4px;   border-radius:4px;   font-family: monospace; }`
    
    Then wrap a small snippet (e.g. via Style Settings) that turns every `⬡[PVx.y]` into `<span class="pv-tag">…</span>`.
    
3. Inline plug-ins  
    A tiny Templater / Meta-Edit / custom plug-in can:
    - Validate that each PV tag exists in your master PV table.
    - Jump from a tag to its definition note.
    - Flag orphaned or deprecated tags when you bump versions.


_Single_ brackets keep PV codes light-weight, non-navigating, and grep-friendly.  
If you ever want them to behave like links, simply run a regex replace `⬡\[(PV\d+\.\d+)\]` → `[[\1]]`—but starting light lets us layer functionality gradually.

Let me know if you want a quick snippet for Dataview or a CSS pill-style!

### 2.5  Audit Block Requirements

> Purpose:  
> All PV-tag structured YAML blocks (e.g., in _Foundational Priors_, _Appendix A_, etc.) must include a minimal audit header before the functional `PV:` or `pv:` block.

### Audit Block Requirements

- Placement:  
  - Insert immediately after the human-readable comments
  - Before any `PV:` or `pv:` data starts
- Structure:  
  A minimal YAML object under the key `audit:`, e.g.:

```yaml
audit:
  status: "Manual audit completed"
  last_audit: "2025-04-25"
  notes: "Validates structure, coherence, sensitivity links. Re-audit needed if PV1.x or PV3.x are modified."
```

| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⬡ PV1.x | Formal object definitions (shared across all documents)                                                 |
| ⬡ PV1.1 | Relevance field $R : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$                                              |

| ⬡ PV2.1 | Cone of concern depends on curvature $\kappa$, $\phi$ alignment, and bounded relevance $R$              |
| ⬡ PV2.2 | Closure occurs only under $\kappa + \mathcal{E} + \Xi > \theta$                                         |
| ⬡ PV2.3 | All closures record $\tau$ (trace) and residual $\eta$ (irreducible core)                               |
| ⬡ PV3.x | Rhetorical and morphism structures                                                                      |
| ⬡ PV3.1 | Morphisms $\pi_i$ operate on $\mathcal{F}$ and modulate constraint engine $\mathcal{C}$                 |
| ⬡ PV3.2 | All rhetorical priors must be reversible or record narrative tension in $\tau$                          |

## 4. Using PV in Your Documents

1. Insert inline markers when a claim depends on architectural priors.
   - E.g. “We define closure as a structural commitment ⬡[PV2.2].”
2. Add a PVS section to any document using this convention.
3. Use PV tags as a checklist for:
   - Structural updates
   - Future rewrites
   - Peer review or formal validation

## 5. Change Management and Re-Audit

If a PV-tagged assumption changes (e.g. we redefine $\Xi$ as a function of $\tau$), the system supports:

- Automated scan for affected references (⬡[PV1.2])
- Dependency trace to determine which closure structures or morphisms must be revalidated
- Versioning tags (e.g. PV1.2 → PV1.2.1) to isolate legacy claims from new ones

## 6. Commentary and Analogues

This system resembles:

- Type Theory (e.g. Coq): where assertions carry types and must be justified
- Category Theory: where morphisms preserve structure and traceable inference is mandatory
- Formal verification: where contracts, invariants, and dependency-aware schemas define correctness

But here, it’s:

- Human-readable
- Philosophically annotated
- Composable across math, narrative, and topology

## 7. The What and Why of “Foundational Priors” that live in two layers ⬡[PV0.1]

> TL;DR  
> *One file explains, the other enforces.*

| Layer                    | File                                            | Role                                                              | Audience                        | PV Relationship                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Narrated/Pedagogic       | [[Foundational Priors v2.2]]                    | • Walk-through of concepts<br>• Diagrams, examples, prose context | Humans (researchers, newcomers) | *Declares* PV tags and shows why they matter    |
| Minimal/Machine-readable | [[Appendix – Architectural Assumptions v2.2]] | • YAML block of PV definitions<br>• Sensitivity matrix only       | Tools, CI tests, code-gen       | *Defines* the canonical meaning of every PV tag |

### 7.1 Why this split?

1. Audit hygiene   
   *Specification* should not drift when explanatory prose is edited.  Keeping the raw PV header in its own file lets automated checks diff a single YAML blob.

2. Pedagogic breathing room   
   The main note can include sidebars, historical context, or optional background reading links without polluting the spec.

3. Multi-tool friendliness   
	- `Appendix A` can be exported straight into Rust build-scripts or Python test-suites.  
	- `Foundational Priors` can include call-outs, images, and long-form argumentation that would break parsers.

4. Versioning granularity   
   Minor wording tweaks in the commentary bump v2.0.x without forcing every downstream module to re-validate. A change to the YAML header bumps v2.x and triggers CI warnings.

### 7.2 Navigational conventions

* In any theory note, PV tags always resolve to `[[Appendix A – Architectural Assumptions v2]]`.  
* If a reader needs intuition, the tag footer in that note points back up to the narrated explanation (§links in Foundational Priors).
* Background primers (e.g. category theory crash-course, Kolmogorov recap) live in the `/pedagogy/` folder and are referenced from the *Background* subsection of each module.

### 7.3 Future automation hooks

* CI — A Git pre-commit hook checks that every `⬡[PVx.y]` appearing in Markdown also exists in the YAML header.  
* Doc-build — The MkDocs pipeline can embed a rendered sensitivity table wherever `{{PV-SENS}}` shortcode appears.  
* IDE lint — Obsidian’s Dataview or a VS Code extension can surface *dangling* PV references inline.

> _Pragmatic rule_: Write prose where humans need clarity; write YAML where computers need certainty.  
> The split lets us optimise for both without compromise.

## Build-/lint hint

> Any CI script can now:
> 1. `grep ⬡PV` in a note.
> 2. Load this YAML.
> 3. Fail the build if a tag is missing or its definition changed without bumping the version.

### How this helps

- Single source of truth: Foundational Priors cites tags; this file _defines_ them.
- Automation-ready: YAML can be parsed by Rust, Python, shell, Obsidian dataview, etc.
- Drift-proof: Change a formula? bump `version:` here, update the YAML entry, watch other notes light up in dataview until they’re re-audited.
- Lightweight: The prose-heavy note stays readable; the spec note stays terse.



> Summary:  
This document isn’t just a guideline. It’s the *structural heart* of your architecture’s modular coherence. Every agent, every warp, every closure, every rhetorical move — when tagged with ⬡ — can be traced, validated, and reasoned about within a living epistemology.
