## Summary
The Unifying Constraint System (UCS) is the core mechanism through which lexical bundles (expressed as tensorial fields) are composed, interrogated, and reconciled within a dynamically warped semantic space.
It is supported by a Prolog-style search and resolution engine, traversing semantic space not symbolically, but tensorially—evaluating compatibility, locating contradiction, and iteratively refining meaning through a dialectic cycle of composition and correction.
Rather than seeking "truth" in a symbolic sense, the UCS identifies regions of contradiction or incoherence, evaluates their semantic geometry, and performs field-level adjustments to restore harmony or reduce dimensionality. In this way, it provides the scaffolding for proposition formation, argument structure, and evolving semantic coherence.
###  Conceptual Structure
#### 1. Lexical Bundles as Tensorial Fields
- Each semantic unit is represented as a tensor or region in a high-dimensional field.
- These units carry potential meanings, activated and modulated through constraint interactions.
#### 2. Constraint Satisfaction as Field Composition
- Constraints govern the composition of these bundles: they are fuzzy, cybernetic, and tensorial.
- A semantic proposition emerges through the successful interaction (composition) of these bundles under active constraints.
#### 3. Prolog-Style Traversal (Backchaining)
- The UCS performs a Prolog-style traversal over the semantic field, looking for incompatibility zones:
    - Where semantic vectors contradict,
    - Where meanings fail to unify,
    - Or where relevance collapses.
- This traversal is geometric rather than symbolic—closer to a space navigation problem than logical deduction.
#### 4. Contradictions as Geometric Anomalies
- Contradictions show up as:
    - Discontinuities, non-overlapping regions, or conflict zones within tensor bundles.
    - These may appear as intersections with high tension, or topological folds in the semantic manifold.
#### 5. Conflict Resolution via Dimensionality Reduction
- Once identified, contradictions are resolved by:
    - Locating key conflicting features using computational geometry,
    - Pruning or reshaping the field,
    - Reducing complexity to restore semantic coherence.

This is not a loss of data—it’s a semantic condensation: incompatible dimensions are either generalized, reweighted, or filtered to preserve fidelity within the relevant context.
###  Integration with Semantic Field Dynamics
- The UCS works cyclically:
    - Lexical bundles are composed in the fuzzy constraint space.
    - Contradictions are identified and resolved.
    - Resulting semantic structures may be passed to a stochastic layer (e.g., agent-level modeling or inference).
    - These are reprojected back into the fuzzy space, potentially as elocutory forces or causally structured meanings.
- Each cycle sharpens, adapts, or transforms the system’s evolving understanding of the proposition.
###  Role of Fibers
- Fibers represent different semantic modalities (e.g. conceptual, connotative, affective).
- The UCS operates across fibers, composing tensor regions within and sometimes between them.
- The choice of fiber, or the traversal between them, is a crucial unresolved part of the system (see below).
###  Unresolved / In Development
- Fiber Interaction Mechanics:  
    The system presently lacks a clear model for how transitions between fibers (e.g., from conceptual to affective) are orchestrated. Do these require mediation, constraint bridges, or internal morphisms?
    
- Reprojection Mechanism (Formalization):  
    While the UCS is presumed to use constraint satisfaction again for reprojection from the stochastic layer, the specific rules guiding what semantic material is carried forward remain undefined.
    
- Geometric Representation of Contradiction:  
    The precise nature of contradictions in tensorial terms (e.g., topological, metric, or algebraic features) needs to be defined or simulated.
    
- Role of Time:  
    The UCS is event-based, and does not currently implement a temporal metric. However, time-sensitive constraints (e.g., discourse memory or decay functions) may eventually be needed to fully simulate narrative flow.
    
- Agent Modeling Precision:  
    Agents are defined as causal primitives, emerging when transitions become conditionally isolated. The UCS supports this, but the internal structure of agent representations in tensorial/stochastic form is still under design.
