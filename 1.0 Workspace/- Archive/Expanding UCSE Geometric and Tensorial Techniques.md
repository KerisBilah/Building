### Goal
Expand the Unified Constraint Satisfaction Engine (UCSE) to include a richer set of computational-geometric and field-theoretic tools for local semantic closure analysis and contradiction resolution — without compromising compositionality or scalability.

---

### Plan Outline

#### 1. Curate Geometric/Topological Techniques for UCSE
- Survey and evaluate candidate techniques:
  - Partial Tucker Decomposition (already in use)
  - Voronoi/Delaunay-based scaffolds (already in use)
  - Watershed segmentation (local contradiction basin detection)
  - Persistence homology (detecting persistent topological features in contradiction landscapes)
  - Ridge-line extraction (semantic pressure fronts)

#### 2. Define Minimal Acceptable Computational Cost
- Reject methods that:
  - Are prohibitively expensive (e.g., global homology across high dimensions),
  - Break compositionality,
  - Require whole-manifold recomputation after local deformation.

#### 3. Define Morphism Interfaces for Each Technique
- Formalize how each tool fits:
  - As a morphism or operator in the $\mathsf{SemField}$ category.
  - Must compose with other UCSE stages without global side effects.

#### 4. Update UCSE Constraint Cycle Diagram
- Add "modulation operators" and "local geometric probes" before closure evaluation.
- Introduce morphism signatures for each added tool.

---

### Key Outputs
- Curated and minimal technique set for geometric/topological UCSE support.
- Morphism definitions for each probe/tool (preserving category structure).
- Updated modular UCSE cycle (including modulation and geometric probes).
- Performance and compositionality notes for each integration.

---

### Notes
- This guarantees UCSE remains composable, scalable, and topologically expressive.
- Prepares ground for rich agent individuation through field-topology sensing.
- Fulfills the broader semantic architecture vision without computational collapse.
