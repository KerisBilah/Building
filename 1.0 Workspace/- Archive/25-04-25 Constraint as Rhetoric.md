## 1 Structural Template Conformance

### 1.1 Motivating Intuition 
⬡[PV0.1]
For centuries, logic was pictured as a flow—from universal truths down to particular instances—structured by diagrams like the Square of Opposition. But even early thinkers like Ockham suspected that this flow was less a law of nature than a rhetorical habit: a compression of language, shaped more by pressure than necessity.

What if meaning does not cascade downward, but strains against itself? What if belief emerges not from inheritance, but from collapse—when tensions in meaning become irreconcilable? Seen this way, constraint is not a limit on thought, but a generator of structure.

We follow that intuition reimagining interpretation not as inference through symbols, but as resolution across a semantic field: a topology of pressures, contradictions, and emergent closures. Belief, in this architecture, is not selected—it is forced by tension, guided by rhetorical strategies that shape the flow of resolution. Constraint becomes rhetoric, and resolution becomes geometry.

This paper proposes a formal account of how constraint resolution, modulated by rhetorical priors, gives rise to expressive belief formation in tensorial semantic systems.

### 1.2 Implicit Questions

| Q1. How do rhetorical priors bias collapse?                                | They modulate the resolution path without altering the field structure.                                                                                          | ⬡[PV3.1]           |

### 1.3 Formal Structure
Introduce $\pi_i$, CMS, TRL; every definition gets its PV tag  
- $\pi_i$ operator ⬡[PV3.1]  
- CMS compositionality ⬡[PV3.3]  
- Collapse threshold recall ⬡[PV2.2]

### Field Rewriting and Sculpting: The Role of the UCSE
⬡[PV3.2]

In addition to the CMS (Constraint Morphism Stack) that modulates resolution pathways, the architecture recognises an internal sculpting mechanism: the Unified Constraint Satisfaction Engine (UCSE).

The UCSE operates entirely inside the fuzzy semantic manifold $\mathcal{F}$, without performing full projection into belief space $\mathcal{B}$.  
It is not a categorical functor like $\mathcal{C} : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$; rather, it acts as a tensorial sculpting engine that prepares material for constraint resolution.

#### Definition: UCSE

Let
$$
\text{UCSE} : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}'
$$

be a dynamic rewriting operator performing local modifications of tensor structure.

Operations performed by UCSE include:
- Partial Tucker Decomposition (PTD) of tensor regions to simplify semantic sheets.
- Scaffold Generation: creation of latent closure frameworks based on partial coherence.
- Contradiction Marking: surfacing latent $\Xi$ fields by tensor amplification.
- Partial Stabilisation: locking tentative local frames without full belief commitment.

The UCSE sculpts $\mathcal{F}$ to make rhetorical tension legible, exposing topologies where CMS morphisms can act meaningfully.

#### Structural Relationship

| Element | Behavior |
|:--------|:---------|
| UCSE | Local rewriting and stabilization inside $\mathcal{F}$. Prepares tension but does not resolve it. |
| CMS | Modulates resolution behavior during constraint evaluation by $\mathcal{C}$. |
| $\mathcal{C}$ | Performs functorial projection of closures into $\mathcal{B}$. |

#### Interpretation

- UCSE is a *semantic sculptor*: it prepares the semantic material by compression, simplification, and contradiction surfacing.
- CMS is a *rhetorical navigator*: it biases how collapse paths are chosen during constraint resolution.
- $\mathcal{C}$ is the *finalizer*: it commits semantic configurations into belief.

> In this architecture, preparation and projection are structurally distinct.  
> Resolution without preparation is brittle; preparation without resolution is inert.

## 2 Constraint Morphism Stacks 
⬡[PV3.3]

### 2.1 Definition 
⬡[PV3.1]  

We define a rhetorical prior $\pi_i$ as a morphism:

$$
\pi_i : (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{C}) \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

where:
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the semantic manifold,
- $\mathcal{C}$ is the constraint evaluation structure,
- $\pi_i$ modulates how constraint resolution flows through $\mathcal{F}$ during collapse evaluation.

A Constraint Morphism Stack (CMS) is a composable chain of priors:

$$
\text{CMS} = \pi_n \circ \pi_{n-1} \circ \cdots \circ \pi_1
$$

Each $\pi_i$ acts locally to bias closure pathways, preserving reversibility and rhetorical continuity.


> Structural Note  
> Each rhetorical prior morphism $\pi_i$ must preserve the narrative trace $\tau$ across deformation and resolution, ensuring that semantic histories remain legible inside $\mathcal{F}$ ⬡[PV3.2].


> Structural Note  
> Each rhetorical prior morphism $\pi_i$ must preserve the narrative trace $\tau$ across deformation and resolution, ensuring that semantic histories remain legible inside $\mathcal{F}$ ⬡[PV3.2].


### 2.6 Theoretical Influences  
(*keep the bibliography bullets, but mark each external theory as inspiration, not PV dependencies*).

The following theoretical constructs inform the design of constraint morphisms:

- Shepard’s Law of Generalisation (Shepard, 1987) — exponential decay in psychological similarity
- Size Principle (Tenenbaum & Griffiths, 2001) — preference for smaller categories under more examples
- Carnap’s $\gamma$-Rule (Carnap, 1950) — probability distribution by conceptual region size
- Geometric Principle of Indifference (Decock et al., 2019) — prior defined over conceptual measure
- Geometric Size Principle (Proposed in this architecture) — likelihood as overlap ratio in conceptual space
- Convexity Constraint (Gärdenfors, 2000) — natural category preference based on convexity
- Voronoi Tessellation as Category Acquisition (Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2008) — proximity-based categorisation

These are implemented as tensor-defined morphisms $\pi_i$, interpretable and composable within $\Pi$.


### 2.10 Concern Reconstruction Operator 
⬡[PV-concern-recon] _(provisional; PV registration pending)_

> Proposition.  
> Even partial reconstruction of an interlocutor’s concern tensor can yield actionable deformation fields, supporting agent modeling without requiring full belief projection.

#### 2.10.1 Observation

Given a region $\Omega \subset \mathcal{F}$, where semantic deformation suggests the presence of an irreducible agent (via persistent $\Xi$, high $\nabla R$, or anchoring mass $\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}$), we wish to infer a *concern reconstruction vector* $\mathbf{c}^\ast$ that approximates the interlocutor’s orientation in $\mathcal{F}$.

#### 2.10.2 Operator Definition

Define the Concern Reconstruction Operator  
$$
\boxed{\;
\mathcal{C}_{\text{recon}} : \Omega \;\longrightarrow\; \mathbf{c}^\ast \in T_{\Omega}\mathcal{F}
\;}
$$  
where:
- $\Omega$ is the observation region (semantic event horizon).
- $T_{\Omega}\mathcal{F}$ is the tangent bundle of $\mathcal{F}$ over $\Omega$ — possible local vector fields.

$\mathcal{C}_{\text{recon}}$ selects $\mathbf{c}^\ast$ to minimize a semantic residual functional $\mathscr{R}$:

$$
\mathbf{c}^\ast = \underset{\mathbf{c}}{\operatorname{argmin}}\, \mathscr{R}(\mathbf{c}, \Omega)
$$

where
$$
\mathscr{R}(\mathbf{c}, \Omega) = \int_{\Omega} \left( \lambda_1 \|\Xi(x) - \widehat{\Xi}_{\mathbf{c}}(x)\|^2 \,+\, \lambda_2 \|\nabla R(x) - \widehat{\nabla R}_{\mathbf{c}}(x)\|^2 \right)\,dx
$$

Here:
- $\widehat{\Xi}_{\mathbf{c}}(x)$ = predicted contradiction field if $\mathbf{c}$ is the true concern vector.
- $\widehat{\nabla R}_{\mathbf{c}}(x)$ = predicted relevance gradient if $\mathbf{c}$ is active at $x$.
- $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$ = tunable weights for contradiction vs concern matching.

#### 2.10.3 Interpretation

- $\mathbf{c}^\ast$ is not a certainty — it is a best-attempt inverse warp, reconstructed from semantic echoes.
- The quality of $\mathbf{c}^\ast$ is measured not by truth but by semantic compression: how much unexplained tension is removed.
- Failure is expected and structural: high residual $\mathscr{R}(\mathbf{c}^\ast, \Omega)$ implies the interlocutor remains largely opaque (high $\rho_{\text{meta}}$).

#### 2.10.4 Collapse Threshold

Optionally, define a *collapse condition*:

If
$$
\mathscr{R}(\mathbf{c}^\ast, \Omega) < \epsilon
$$
for some threshold $\epsilon > 0$, then $\mathbf{c}^\ast$ may be promoted to a belief-level model in $\mathcal{B}$.

Otherwise, it remains a semantic vector field hypothesis inside $\mathcal{F}$.

### 2.11 Affective Modulation as Semantic Strategy
⬡[PV3.5]

Emotion is treated here not as a reactive overlay but as a cybernetic modulation of semantic traversal inside $\mathcal{F}$.  
Each affect biases the Tensor Resolution Layer ($\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$), influencing what gets prioritized, deferred, or collapsed during preparation for resolution.

> Architectural Note  
> Affective modulation operates over the pre-agentive teleological field $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ ⬡[PV1.5], biasing natural tension-resolving flows before full agentive commitment occurs.

#### 2.11.1 Affects as Curvature and Pressure Operators

Each affect modifies specific tensor fields:

| Affect | Effect in $\mathcal{F}$ | Notes |
|:------|:------------------------|:------|
| Interest–Excitement | Amplifies $\nabla R$, increasing concern density | Drives semantic engagement |
| Startle | Spikes $\kappa$, disrupts $\tau$, resets local narrative | Prepares for reconfiguration |
| Fear | Inverts $\phi$, redirects flow away from high-entropy zones | Aversion strategy |
| Irritation | Emerges when $H(\Sigma) > \epsilon$ for sustained time; dampens traversal | Compression pressure |
| Joy–Enjoyment | Expands local semantic connectivity, increases $\gamma$ temporarily | Strengthens cohesion |
| Shame–Humiliation | Contracts projection, lowers $\rho_{\text{meta}}$ visibility temporarily | Defensive retraction |

These affective signatures can be modelled either as scalar fields or as PDE-like vector modulations, depending on application.


#### 2.11.2 Affective Modulation Kernel

Define an affective modulation kernel:
$$
\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}} : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
$$
assigning to each point $x \in \mathcal{F}$ an $n$-dimensional vector of affective pressures.

$\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$ is used as a soft constraint or dynamic weight during $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ traversal.


#### 2.11.3 Affect-Driven Prior Selection

Each affect $a_k$ induces a rhetorical prior $\pi_k$ that modulates constraint behaviour:

| Affect | Induced Prior $\pi_k$ | Effect |
|:------|:----------------------|:------|
| Interest | $\pi_{\text{interest}}$ | Opens concern pathways; steepens $\nabla R$ |
| Startle | $\pi_{\text{startle}}$ | Resets short-term narrative $\tau$ |
| Fear | $\pi_{\text{fear}}$ | Avoids regions with rising $\mathcal{E}$ |
| Irritation | $\pi_{\text{irrit}}$ | Raises contradiction sensitivity threshold $\theta$ |
| Joy | $\pi_{\text{joy}}$ | Increases semantic cohesion across regions |
| Shame | $\pi_{\text{shame}}$ | Contracts expressive projection under high contradiction |

Thus affective states dynamically shift rhetorical strategy even before full commitment.

#### What This Adds

- Anchors Sylvan Tomkins' affect theory inside $\mathcal{F}$ as a field-internal modulation layer.
- Clarifies how emotional dynamics selectively filter irreducible space.
- Extends the expressive repertoire of rhetorical priors $\pi_k$.
- Preserves formal separation: no premature projection into $\mathcal{B}$ required.

## 2.12 Scaffolded Closure and Partial Narratives
⬡[PV3.7]

> Proposition.  
> Semantic traversal often produces regions of partial stability without full belief commitment. These "scaffolded closures" enable local narrative coherence inside $\mathcal{F}$ without requiring projection into $\mathcal{B}$.

### 2.12.1 Definition: Scaffolded Closure Operator

Define the Scaffolded Closure Operator:

$$
\boxed{\;
\mathcal{S} : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}
\;}
$$

where:
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the semantic manifold,
- $\mathcal{S}$ identifies local zones $\Omega_s \subset \mathcal{F}$ where semantic stabilization occurs without full projection.

Formally, for a region $\Omega \subset \mathcal{F}$:

$$
\mathcal{S}(\Omega) \;=\; 
\begin{cases}
\Omega_s & \text{if } \kappa(\Omega) + \mathcal{E}(\Omega) > \theta_s \text{ and } \Xi(\Omega) \approx 0 \\[6pt]
\varnothing & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where:
- $\kappa(\Omega)$ is local curvature,
- $\mathcal{E}(\Omega)$ is informational density,
- $\Xi(\Omega)$ is contradiction field magnitude,
- $\theta_s$ is a *scaffold threshold* ($\theta_s < \theta$, the full closure threshold).

Thus, a scaffolded region $\Omega_s$ is stable enough for narrative accumulation, but too weak for full agentive commitment.

### 2.12.2 Scaffolded Narrative Accrual

Each scaffolded region contributes a local narrative increment:

$$
\Delta\tau_{\text{scaffold}}(\Omega_s)
$$

This acts as semantic memory inside $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$:

- Tracks provisional structure,
- Guides future traversal and possible closure,
- Supports partial integration of meaning without forcing belief.

Scaffolded narratives may accumulate across multiple traversal steps, producing increasingly structured regions that may *later* meet full closure conditions.


### 2.12.3 Collapse Promotion: Scaffold to Belief

We define a promotion condition:

If a scaffolded region $\Omega_s$ evolves such that:

$$
\kappa(\Omega_s) + \mathcal{E}(\Omega_s) + \Xi(\Omega_s) > \theta
$$

then the scaffold collapses into a full closure event, and projection into $\mathcal{B}$ occurs:

$$
\mathcal{C}(\Omega_s) = \hat{\mathcal{A}}
$$

Otherwise, $\Omega_s$ remains internal to $\mathcal{F}$, enriching traversal but not altering belief space.

### 2.12.4 Interpretation

- Scaffolded Closure = *semantic stabiliser*: protects partial structure inside $\mathcal{F}$ during complex traversal.
- Partial Narrative = *provisional story fragments*: accumulate without hard commitment.
- Promotion = *latent agency*: sculpts a field toward eventual closure when pressure builds.

This mechanism enables the architecture to:
- Delay premature commitment,
- Stabilize interpretive preparation,
- Foster multi-step meaning construction across time.

### What This Adds

- Introduces a new core semantic object ($\Omega_s$ = scaffolded region).
- Extends the Tensor Resolution Layer $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ with semantic scaffolding capability.
- Bridges to second-order modeling: scaffolds become candidates for concern reconstruction.

### 2.13 Mirror Reconstruction Operator
⬡[PV3.8]

> Proposition.  
> Partial reconstruction of another agent's warp in $\mathcal{F}$ enables pre-belief modeling of semantic action without commitment to full referential belief.

#### 2.13.1 Operator Definition

Define the Mirror Reconstruction Operator:
$$
\boxed{
\mathcal{M}_{\text{mirror}} : \Omega \longrightarrow \mathbf{w}^\ast \in T_{\Omega}\mathcal{F}
}
$$
where:
- $\Omega \subset \mathcal{F}$ is the observation region,
- $T_{\Omega}\mathcal{F}$ is the tangent bundle over $\Omega$ (local semantic flows),
- $\mathbf{w}^\ast$ is the reconstructed warp vector field approximating another agent's concern-driven deformation.

$\mathcal{M}_{\text{mirror}}$ seeks to minimise a warp residual functional $\mathscr{W}$:
$$
\mathbf{w}^\ast = \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\operatorname{argmin}}\, \mathscr{W}(\mathbf{w}, \Omega)
$$

where
$$
\mathscr{W}(\mathbf{w}, \Omega) = \int_{\Omega} \left( 
\lambda_1 \| \Xi(x) - \widehat{\Xi}_{\mathbf{w}}(x) \|^2 \,+\,
\lambda_2 \| \nabla R(x) - \widehat{\nabla R}_{\mathbf{w}}(x) \|^2
\right)\,dx
$$

with:
- $\widehat{\Xi}_{\mathbf{w}}(x)$ = predicted contradiction if $\mathbf{w}$ is active,
- $\widehat{\nabla R}_{\mathbf{w}}(x)$ = predicted relevance gradient under $\mathbf{w}$,
- $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$ = weighting parameters.

#### 2.13.2 Interpretation

- $\mathbf{w}^\ast$ represents a mirrored internalization of another agent’s influence — *not* a full belief.
- It is pre-commitment: the semantic manifold bends inward, rehearsing the other's concern vector without adopting it.
- Failure is structural: large residual $\mathscr{W}(\mathbf{w}^\ast, \Omega)$ signifies irreducible otherness.

#### 2.13.3 Collapse Condition (Optional)

If
$$
\mathscr{W}(\mathbf{w}^\ast, \Omega) < \epsilon
$$
for some threshold $\epsilon > 0$, then $\mathbf{w}^\ast$ may support second-order belief modeling in $\mathcal{B}$ (see Luhmann projections).

Otherwise, $\mathbf{w}^\ast$ remains a scaffolded mirror trace inside $\mathcal{F}$.

> The Unified Constraint Satisfaction Engine (UCSE) operates not as a global functor, but as a dynamic, local tensor-sculpting engine within $\mathcal{F}$, preparing semantic material for rhetorical tension and potential belief formation.

#### 2.14.1 Conceptual Role

UCSE acts as an internal sculptor, performing:
- Local rewrites of tensor configurations
- Partial stabilization and destabilization
- Marking contradictions and compression failures
- Preparing semantic terrain for potential closure

It does not collapse into $\mathcal{B}$ directly.
It does not enforce projection.
It prepares $\mathcal{F}$ for $\mathcal{C}$ to act.

#### 2.14.2 Operator Definition

Define the UCSE operator:
$$
\boxed{
\mathcal{U} : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}'
}
$$
where:
- $\mathcal{F}$ = current semantic manifold
- $\mathcal{F}'$ = sculpted, contradiction-exposed, closure-prepared manifold

$\mathcal{U}$ performs localized transformations:
$$
\mathcal{U}(x) = \text{Rewrite}\bigl(\Xi(x), \kappa(x), R(x), \phi(x), \tau(x)\bigr)
$$

#### 2.14.3 Core Actions of $\mathcal{U}$

| Action | Description | Target |
| :----: | ----------- | ------ |
| PTD (Partial Tensor Decomposition) | Decompose semantic clusters into dominant modes | $R$, $\Xi$ |
| Scaffold Generation | Create local closure candidates (pre-commit frames) | $\kappa$, $R$ |
| Contradiction Marking | Highlight zones of persistent deformation | $\Xi$ |
| Warp Stabilization | Flatten minor contradictions without projection | $R$, $\phi$ |
| Narrative Realignment | Adjust $\tau$ based on tension history | $\tau$ |

Each action operates locally in $\mathcal{F}$, preserving non-destructive, reversible semantic structures.

#### 2.14.4 Formal Property

UCSE respects field continuity:
$$
\mathcal{U} : C^0(\mathcal{F}) \to C^0(\mathcal{F}')
$$
(*it preserves semantic continuity even while sculpting internal structure*).

It prepares regions where closure might occur, but leaves final commitment to $\mathcal{C}$.

#### 2.14.5 Interpretation

- $\mathcal{U}$ is a semantic preparation engine.
- It acts analogously to TRL-inf, but is more transformative:  
  $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ amplifies and routes,  
  $\mathcal{U}$ rewrites and sculpts.
- Rhetorical priors ($\pi_i$) bias $\mathcal{U}$ by influencing which rewrites, scaffolds, or stabilisations are prioritised.

### 2.15 Scaffolded Closure and Partial Narratives
⬡[PV3.10]

> Proposition.  
> Scaffolded closures are local, provisional structures in $\mathcal{F}$ where semantic tensions are partially stabilized without full belief collapse. They generate partial narratives — reversible pathways that prefigure but do not enforce projection into $\mathcal{B}$.

#### 2.15.1 Conceptual Role

When $\mathcal{U}$ (UCSE) identifies zones of emergent closure pressure, it may construct semantic scaffolds:
- Temporary configurations reducing local contradiction
- Partial narrative paths $\tau_{\text{scaffold}}$
- Proto-agentive regions where commitment *could* occur but has not yet

These scaffolds prepare the field for potential belief, without locking in.

#### 2.15.2 Scaffold Definition

Define a semantic scaffold $\mathcal{S}$ as a triple:
$$
\boxed{
\mathcal{S} = (\Omega, \tau_{\text{scaffold}}, \sigma_{\text{closure}})
}
$$
where:
- $\Omega \subset \mathcal{F}$ = scaffolded region
- $\tau_{\text{scaffold}}$ = partial narrative trace within $\Omega$
- $\sigma_{\text{closure}}$ = closure likelihood function $\sigma: \Omega \to [0,1]$

$\sigma_{\text{closure}}(x)$ expresses the *local probability or readiness* for projection.

#### 2.15.3 Construction Mechanism

A scaffold $\mathcal{S}$ is generated by UCSE when:

1. Persistent curvature $\kappa(x)$ exceeds a threshold $\theta_\kappa$
2. Residual contradiction $\|\Xi(x)\|$ falls below $\epsilon_\Xi$
3. Anchoring mass $\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}(x)$ stabilizes (no wild fluctuations)

Formally:
$$
\text{Scaffold Condition:}\quad
\kappa(x) > \theta_\kappa \;\wedge\;
\|\Xi(x)\| < \epsilon_\Xi \;\wedge\;
\left| \nabla \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}(x) \right| < \delta
$$

If satisfied across a coherent region $\Omega$, UCSE seeds $\tau_{\text{scaffold}}$ and assigns $\sigma_{\text{closure}}$ based on local field stability.

#### 2.15.4 Partial Narrative Trace

$\tau_{\text{scaffold}}$ records:
- The dominant semantic flows (teleological directions $\phi$)
- The inferred proto-agentive pressures
- Historical deformation events in $\Omega$

It does not commit these events as true belief narratives yet — it keeps them reversible.

Think of $\tau_{\text{scaffold}}$ as a speculative semantic memory.

#### 2.15.5 Interpretation

- Scaffolded closures stage meaning without forcing it.
- They allow an agent (or a system) to track *possible future beliefs* under development.
- They offer low-cost cognitive rehearsal: preparing for commitment without risk.
- If rhetorical pressure or external reinforcement later increases, $\mathcal{C}$ can "collapse" $\mathcal{S}$ into a full projection.

#### 2.15.6 Mirror Connection

This mechanism naturally expresses mirror neuron behavior in $\mathcal{F}$:
- Observed agentive action → generates scaffold $\mathcal{S}$
- Scaffold simulates probable closure paths
- No belief or goal attribution yet — only *readiness* and *partial resonance*

Thus, mirror phenomena are scaffolded closures:  
interpretive rehearsals before belief or action commitment.

## 3. Traversal Logic TRL _inf_ 
⬡[PV1.2] ⬡[PV2.1]

This section introduces $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$, the Prolog-style inference layer that performs semantic traversal and configuration within the fuzzy tensor field $\mathcal{F}$. It operates as the active core of the Tensor Resolution Layer (TRL), performing recursive, non-destructive field transformations in preparation for constraint resolution by $\mathcal{C}$.

### Definition: $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$

Let $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ be the field-level traversal logic responsible for semantic inference within $\mathcal{F}$.

We define:
$$
\text{TRL}_\text{inf} : (\mathcal{F}, \Xi, \kappa, R, \phi, \tau) \to \mathcal{F}'
$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the semantic tensor manifold
- $\Xi$ is the contradiction tensor field
- $\kappa$ is tensor curvature
- $R$ is the relevance (concern) field
- $\phi$ is the teleological vector field
- $\tau$ is the narrative trace

$\mathcal{F}'$ is a transformed semantic field prepared for constraint evaluation.

#### Properties:

1. Non-destructive  
   $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ does not perform projection into $\mathcal{B}$, and never collapses semantic configurations into beliefs. It preserves reversibility and supports recursive exploration.

2. Backchaining & Field Unification  
   It supports traversal through $\Xi$ to identify the sources of contradiction, unify partial tensor fragments, and recover consistent local frames.

3. Field Operations  
   It performs:
   - Amplification of concern or curvature
   - Suppression of irrelevant or deferrable regions
   - Reorganisation of tensor configurations (e.g., topological rewrites or simplifications)

4. Rhetorical Responsiveness  
   $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ is modulated by rhetorical priors $\pi_i$ defined over the constraint morphism stack. These influence how contradictions are interpreted and prepared for potential resolution.

5. Semantic Logic as Algebra  
   It enables a form of geometric algebra over tensor fields — supporting inferential operations such as generalisation, reduction, disambiguation, and closure pattern matching.

### Relation to $\mathcal{C}$

While $\mathcal{C}$ performs the actual projection from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ (i.e., belief commitment), $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ handles all semantic material prior to projection.

- $\mathcal{C}$ is a modular stack of constraint morphisms: 
$$
\mathcal{C} := \pi_n \circ \cdots \circ \pi_1
$$
  where each $\pi_i$ is a resolution bias operator.

- $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ is the preparatory traversal logic that makes $\mathcal{F}$ ready for $\mathcal{C}$'s evaluation, ensuring that: 
	- Contradictions are exposed and clarified
	- Tensor sheets are amplified or reduced
	- Closure potentials are legible to the constraint logic

### Interpretation

$\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ is best understood as Prolog-style geometric logic:
- It traverses, evaluates, and tests configurations, not symbols
- It supports non-monotonic exploration and backtracking
- It listens to semantic structure rather than speaking belief

It allows the system to think through space — to reason across tensions and topologies in $\mathcal{F}$ without committing prematurely to beliefs in $\mathcal{B}$.

## 4. Expressive Catalogue of Priors 
⬡[PV3.1]

*(What is now §5 & §6 combined; each prior gets a micro-definition block.)*

### 4.1 Catalog of Expressive Strategies

Inspired by classical stasis theory:
- $\pi_{\text{conj}}$​: existential or evidentiary preference
- $\pi_{\text{def}}$​: typological reinterpretation
- $\pi_{\text{qual}}$​: salience reweighting
- $\pi_{\text{pol}}$​: action priming

Proposed additional strategies:
- $\pi_{\text{sym}}$​: preserve symmetrical ambiguity
- $\pi_{\text{min}}$​: minimise closure size
- $\pi_{\text{teleo}}$ ​: maximise alignment with $\phi$

### 4.2 Constraint Geometry and Semantic Topology

How priors induce topological signatures:
- Warping closure basins
- Raising/lowering curvature thresholds
- Generating stable attractors vs. deferrals

Visualisations or analogies: rhetorical priors as _semantic weather patterns_

## 5. Triadic Commitment & KAI Alignment 
⬡[PV4.2] ⬡[PV4.3]

To clarify the structure of belief projection and rhetorical resolution, we now integrate the triadic agent model:

$$
\mathcal{P} = (\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})
$$

Where:

- $\mathcal{S}$: the subject or emitter — the agent initiating closure or belief commitment
- $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$: the addressee — the pragmatically inferred or explicit recipient of interpretation or action
- $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$: the referent — the agent or entity being modeled, interpreted, or committed to in belief space

This structure makes each projection not just a belief, but an act of situated semantic address.

### 2.8.1 Projection as Triadic Commit

Belief projection becomes triad-specific:

$$
\mathcal{C}(\Omega) = \hat{\mathcal{A}}_{\mathcal{S} \to \bar{\mathcal{A}}}
$$

This expresses the full rhetorical force of a commitment:

- Who committed (emitter: $\mathcal{S}$)
- Toward whom (addressee: $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$)
- About what (referent: $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$)

This is essential for:

- Dialogue modeling
- Agentive inference under ambiguity
- Tracking multi-agent resolution dynamics

### 2.8.2 KAI in Triadic Form

To support alignment and epistemic coherence, we define the triadic KAI tuple:
$$
\text{KAI}_{\mathcal{P}} = \left( \text{KAI}(\hat{\mathcal{A}}), \text{KAI}(\bar{\mathcal{A}}), \text{KAI}(\mathcal{S}) \right)
$$
Where:

- $\text{KAI}(\hat{\mathcal{A}})$ measures irreducibility of the referent
- $\text{KAI}(\bar{\mathcal{A}})$ measures the salience of communicative force  
	_(e.g., pragmatic pressure on the addressee — how strongly the utterance "lands")_
- $\text{KAI}(\mathcal{S})$ measures closure pressure or commitment threshold of the emitter

This supports a formal notion of triadic alignment:

#### Definition: KAI Alignment

Let $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ be triadic configurations projected by different agents from the same region $\Omega \subset \mathcal{F}$. Define the KAI alignment distance:
$$
d_{\text{KAI}}(\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2) = \left\| \text{KAI}_{\mathcal{P}_1} - \text{KAI}_{\mathcal{P}_2} \right\|
$$
>_All KAI values are assumed normalised to a shared metric space to ensure comparability across agents._

Then:
- Low $d_{\text{KAI}}$ indicates interpretive alignment
- High $d_{\text{KAI}}$ signals divergence in referential modeling, addressability, or emission force

This metric can be used to:
- Trigger clarification morphisms
- Detect emergent narrative conflict
- Optimise multi-agent rhetorical flow

### 2.8.3 Action as Triadic Projection

When an action morphism becomes viable:
$$
\phi \cdot \nabla R > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{Act}^\dagger = 1
$$
We now interpret this as a triadic projection:
- $\mathcal{S}$ initiates closure (e.g. speaks, moves, declares)
- $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$ is explicitly or implicitly addressed
- $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$ is committed as the referent of belief

This gives each act semantic depth and narrative structure.

### 2.8.4 Implications for TRL and Morphisms

- $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ may prioritise contradiction chains based on triadic narrative salience
- Constraint morphisms $\pi_i$ can now be indexed by triadic configuration:
  
#### Constraint Morphism Naming Style
  $$
  \pi_i^{(\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})} : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}'
  $$
_Example:_  
$$
\pi_{\text{pol}}^{(\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})} \text{ increases commitment pressure when } \bar{\mathcal{A}} = \hat{\mathcal{A}}, \text{ and dampens it when they diverge.}
$$

- This enables agent-specific rhetorical behaviour, dialogue modeling, and story-consistent belief trajectories
