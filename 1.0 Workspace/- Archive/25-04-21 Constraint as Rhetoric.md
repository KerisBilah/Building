## Constraint as Rhetoric: On the Expressiveness of Resolution Strategies in Topological Semantic Systems

### Abstract (draft)
This paper introduces a formal account of rhetorical priors within a tensor-based semantic architecture. These priors guide how contradictions are interpreted and resolved by the constraint satisfaction engine that mediates between a fuzzy semantic field ($\mathcal{F}$) and a belief space ($\mathcal{B}$). Rather than encoding propositional content, rhetorical priors define geometric heuristics for semantic collapse — shaping the topology of commitment, action, and agentive belief. Drawing inspiration from classical stasis theory and replacing symbolic sublogics with spatial reasoning, we explore a new layer of expressiveness that lives not in beliefs, but in the dynamics that form them.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 From Logic to Constraint

The Aristotelian Square of Opposition has long served as a visual emblem of how truth might circulate between universals and particulars. In its classical form, most clearly formalised by Boethius, it established four core relations—contradiction, contrariety, sub-contrariety, and subalternation—that structured inference in terms of what must or must not follow from a given proposition. A universal truth like “All humans are mortal” was thought to imply its particular instances, while particular truths couldn’t necessarily climb back up the ladder. From this symbolic architecture emerged a broader sensibility: the idea that logic charts the space of possibility, where belief flows downward from the general to the specific. But even in the medieval period William of Ockham, suspicious of such structural inheritance, argued that universals were not real but merely convenient compressions of language. He distrusted the clean verticality of truth and began to suggest that what appears as logical necessity might instead be rhetorical habit—something shaped by pressure rather than inherent form.

That suspicion stayed with me. I began to see meaning not as a matter of inheritance, but of tension. What if truth doesn’t flow, but buckles, warps, and occasionally snaps under stress? What if belief emerges not from implication, but from collapse—when a system can no longer reconcile its parts? This shift of sensibility turned my attention to constraint, not as a limiting force, but as a generative one. A love of logic grid puzzles had already introduced me to the aesthetic of closure—that moment when partial exclusions and scattered clues align into a single coherent shape. A youthful course in Prolog reminded me of how contradiction could drive semantic construction. These weren’t just tools for modeling logic; they were languages for shaping it. As this project took shape, I realised I no longer needed a sublogic. What I needed was a field—a space where meanings strain against one another, where interpretation is a process of negotiation, and where rhetorical strategies guide the emergence of belief. The square of opposition hadn’t become obsolete—it had unfolded into a geometry. And stasis theory, once a tool of orators, returned not as a theory of persuasion but as a topology of resolution. It offered a way to think about disagreement not as a failure of logic, but as a kind of topological feature—a wrinkle or ridge in the semantic terrain, where pressure gathers and decisions are made. This paper follows that intuition and proposes a new kind of expressiveness: not a logic of implication, but a rhetoric of constraint.

###  1.2 The Engine Beneath: How Resolution Feels

Beneath the surface of interpretation, behind every belief or utterance that feels deliberate, something quieter and stranger is happening. The constraint engine—$\mathcal{C}$—is where this happens. It doesn’t think in words. It doesn’t infer using syllogisms. It listens to a field of tensions, contradictions, and entangled relevance, and it moves toward resolution like water seeking downhill.

Inside this engine, beliefs do not form because they are selected. They form because they are _forced_—because a region of semantic space becomes irreducible, warped beyond repair, and the system must commit to some configuration that can hold. In this sense, the engine is not deciding so much as yielding to pressure. But how it yields—_where_ it closes, _how_ it deforms, *which resolution path it follows—*this is where the system becomes expressive.

The engine is governed by tensors—mathematical objects that don’t just carry values, but organise those values across space, interaction, and concern. These tensors aren’t fixed; they stretch and pull in response to meaning. They encode salience, contradiction, entropy, closure pressure. When enough of these forces converge, a collapse occurs: a soft surface buckles, and what was once ambiguous becomes a belief.

But collapse doesn’t happen on its own. It is shaped. The constraint engine doesn’t resolve tension in a vacuum—it does so through rhetorical priors. These are not beliefs themselves, but strategies embedded in the resolution system: biases for how contradiction should be treated, whether ambiguity should be preserved, when pressure justifies action, and when it does not. These strategies don’t merely influence the result—they sculpt the topology of the resolution process itself.

You might imagine this visually, like a flexible semantic terrain. Contradictions are ridges, valleys, cliffs. Relevance flows like a pressure gradient, moving through this landscape. And the rhetorical priors? They’re like weather systems, each bringing a different atmosphere. One might thicken the air over certain contradictions, delaying collapse. Another might thin the membrane between fields, encouraging rapid commitment. Some strategies sharpen the edges of categories; others blur them. The terrain is always the same, but the way it folds and resolves is constantly reshaped.

This is not symbolic logic. This is geometric computation—a field of force and deformation, of regions and flows. Techniques like Voronoi diagrams, triangulation, and spline mapping aren’t just metaphors; they’re tools. The engine can draw boundaries, discover attractors, measure how semantic configurations lean into one another or pull apart. Beliefs, in this view, are not static conclusions—they’re topological commitments, formed where tension demands resolution.

As we move forward, we’ll catalog the kinds of resolution strategies this architecture allows—how they modulate constraint flow, shape closure, and give voice to different rhetorical dispositions. What begins in contradiction becomes structure. What begins in pressure becomes form. And what begins in ambiguity becomes, at last, a belief.

## 2. Constraint Morphism Stacks: A Compositional Architecture for Resolution Bias

This section introduces the Constraint Morphism Stack (CMS) — a compositional framework for shaping the behaviour of the constraint engine $\mathcal{C}$ through modular, tensor-defined influence operators. These morphisms express rhetorical and generalisation priors as internal, stackable modifications to semantic resolution dynamics. Each morphism respects the architecture's geometric and functorial structure, and together they define the central analytical mechanism through which belief, commitment, and action trajectories are shaped.

### 2.1 Definition

Let each constraint morphism $\pi_i$ be an operator of the form:
$$
\pi_i : (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{C}) \to \mathcal{C}
$$
It maps a semantic configuration and the current constraint resolution logic to a modified resolution engine. These morphisms live entirely within the tensorial semantics of the architecture, and operate as modulators of resolution pressure, closure prioritisation, and agentive bias.

A Constraint Morphism Stack (CMS) is a composition of such morphisms:
$$
\text{CMS} := \pi_n \circ \cdots \circ \pi_2 \circ \pi_1
$$
This stack is applied to $\mathcal{C}$ as a compound modulation strategy. Each morphism modifies the constraint behaviour in a manner compliant with the field's topology and the projection structure from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{B}$.

### 2.2 Category Structure

Let $\Pi$ denote the category of constraint morphisms.

- Objects: Parametric configurations of $\mathcal{C}$
- Morphisms: Influence operators $\pi_i : \mathcal{C}_1 \to \mathcal{C}_2$

The category $\Pi$ must satisfy:
- Associativity:
$$
(\pi_3 \circ \pi_2) \circ \pi_1 = \pi_3 \circ (\pi_2 \circ \pi_1)
$$
- Identity:
$$
\exists \, \pi_{\text{id}} \in \Pi \; \text{such that} \; \pi_{\text{id}} \circ \pi_i = \pi_i \circ \pi_{\text{id}} = \pi_i
$$
### 2.3 Morphism Implementation Schema

Each morphism operates as a tensorial field operator:
$$
\pi_i : (\Xi, \kappa, R, \phi, \tau) \mapsto \delta \mathcal{C}
$$
Where:

- $\Xi$ is the contradiction tensor
- $\kappa$ is local curvature
- $R$ is the concern/relevance field
- $\phi$ is the teleological vector field
- $\tau$ is the narrative trace

$\delta \mathcal{C}$ represents the delta or modulation applied to the constraint engine.

### 2.4 Traversal Inference: The Operational Logic of TRL

This section introduces $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$, the Prolog-style inference layer that performs semantic traversal and configuration within the fuzzy tensor field $\mathcal{F}$. It operates as the active core of the Tensor Resolution Layer (TRL), performing recursive, non-destructive field transformations in preparation for constraint resolution by $\mathcal{C}$.

### Definition: $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$

Let $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ be the field-level traversal logic responsible for semantic inference within $\mathcal{F}$.

We define:
$$
\text{TRL}_\text{inf} : (\mathcal{F}, \Xi, \kappa, R, \phi, \tau) \to \mathcal{F}'
$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{F}$ is the semantic tensor manifold
- $\Xi$ is the contradiction tensor field
- $\kappa$ is tensor curvature
- $R$ is the relevance (concern) field
- $\phi$ is the teleological vector field
- $\tau$ is the narrative trace

$\mathcal{F}'$ is a transformed semantic field prepared for constraint evaluation.

#### Properties:

1. Non-destructive  
   $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ does not perform projection into $\mathcal{B}$, and never collapses semantic configurations into beliefs. It preserves reversibility and supports recursive exploration.

2. Backchaining & Field Unification  
   It supports traversal through $\Xi$ to identify the sources of contradiction, unify partial tensor fragments, and recover consistent local frames.

3. Field Operations  
   It performs:
   - Amplification of concern or curvature
   - Suppression of irrelevant or deferrable regions
   - Reorganisation of tensor configurations (e.g., topological rewrites or simplifications)

4. Rhetorical Responsiveness  
   $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ is modulated by rhetorical priors $\pi_i$ defined over the constraint morphism stack. These influence how contradictions are interpreted and prepared for potential resolution.

5. Semantic Logic as Algebra  
   It enables a form of geometric algebra over tensor fields — supporting inferential operations such as generalisation, reduction, disambiguation, and closure pattern matching.

### Relation to $\mathcal{C}$

While $\mathcal{C}$ performs the actual projection from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ (i.e., belief commitment), $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ handles all semantic material prior to projection.

- $\mathcal{C}$ is a modular stack of constraint morphisms: 
$$
\mathcal{C} := \pi_n \circ \cdots \circ \pi_1
$$
  where each $\pi_i$ is a resolution bias operator.

- $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ is the preparatory traversal logic that makes $\mathcal{F}$ ready for $\mathcal{C}$'s evaluation, ensuring that:
  - Contradictions are exposed and clarified
  - Tensor sheets are amplified or reduced
  - Closure potentials are legible to the constraint logic

### Interpretation

$\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ is best understood as Prolog-style geometric logic:
- It traverses, evaluates, and tests configurations, not symbols
- It supports non-monotonic exploration and backtracking
- It listens to semantic structure rather than speaking belief

It allows the system to think through space — to reason across tensions and topologies in $\mathcal{F}$ without committing prematurely to beliefs in $\mathcal{B}$.

### 2.5 Example Stack

An agent designed for fast, proximal, goal-aligned resolution might use:
$$
\text{CMS}_{\text{actional}} = \pi_{\text{pol}} \circ \pi_{\text{size}} \circ \pi_{\text{Shepard}}
$$
This composite bias:
- Localises contradiction influence (Shepard)
- Prefers compact conceptual regions (Size Principle)
- Triggers commitment when alignment with $\phi$ is strong (Policy Bias)

### 2.6 Theoretical References and Influences

The following theoretical constructs inform the design of constraint morphisms:
- Shepard’s Law of Generalisation (Shepard, 1987) — exponential decay in psychological similarity
- Size Principle (Tenenbaum & Griffiths, 2001) — preference for smaller categories under more examples
- Carnap’s $\gamma$-Rule (Carnap, 1950) — probability distribution by conceptual region size
- Geometric Principle of Indifference (Decock et al., 2019) — prior defined over conceptual measure
- Geometric Size Principle (Proposed in this architecture) — likelihood as overlap ratio in conceptual space
- Convexity Constraint (Gärdenfors, 2000) — natural category preference based on convexity
- Voronoi Tessellation as Category Acquisition (Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2008) — proximity-based categorisation

These are implemented as tensor-defined morphisms $\pi_i$, interpretable and composable within $\Pi$.

### 2.7 Conceptual Morphisms and Interpretive Geometry

This section extends the Constraint Morphism Stack (CMS) with a new class of resolution operators: conceptual morphisms. These operators are grounded in the formalism of *fuzzy star-shaped conceptual spaces* (Bechberger & Kühnberger, 2019) and allow the constraint engine $\mathcal{C}$ to perform subtle geometric operations such as projection, correlation-sensitive intersection, reformation of conceptual centers, and graded subsethood checking.

These morphisms are particularly useful for:
- Modeling domain-specific interpretive strategies
- Shaping topological bias in constraint resolution
- Embedding structured concepts directly into semantic traversal dynamics

### 2.7.1 Formal Definition

A conceptual morphism is a tensor-defined transformation:
$$
\pi^{\text{concept}}_i : \mathcal{F}_\delta \to \delta \mathcal{C}
$$
Where:
- $\mathcal{F}_\delta \subset \mathcal{F}$ is a structured subspace endowed with local metric and fuzzy geometry
- $\delta \mathcal{C}$ is a modulated constraint logic, shaped by conceptual operations

These morphisms compose with rhetorical priors and generalisation biases in the CMS, preserving functorial and geometric structure.

### 2.7.2 Core Morphism Types

| Morphism | Description | Function |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| $\pi^{\text{proj}}_\delta$ | Projection onto subdomain $\delta$ | Restricts constraint evaluation to a set of quality dimensions |
| $\pi^{\text{int}}$ | Fuzzy intersection of conceptual fields | Narrows resolution to overlapping conceptual regions |
| $\pi^{\text{star}}$ | Star-shaped reformation | Recenters the semantic field around a prototype attractor |
| $\pi^{\text{sub}}$ | Subsethood checking | Suppresses or modulates projection when a region is nested within an existing belief |
| $\pi^{\text{cut}}_d$ | Axis-aligned semantic bifurcation | Splits a region along dimension $d$ at threshold $v$ |

Each operator is defined in terms of fuzzy membership functions, correlation-aware distance metrics, and volume-based measures over $\alpha$-cuts.

### 2.7.3 Composition Example

A resolution strategy biased toward stable concepts and spatial alignment might use:
$$
\text{CMS}_{\text{stable\_conceptual}} = \pi_{\text{qual}} \circ \pi^{\text{star}} \circ \pi^{\text{sub}} \circ \pi_{\text{Shepard}}
$$
This stack:
- Prioritises salience-sensitive contradictions
- Recenters resolution around strong conceptual attractors
- Suppresses projection if an equivalent belief is already held
- Applies proximity-weighted influence fields

### 2.7.4 Integration with TRL and Inference

Conceptual morphisms are applied within the traversal layer $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ and passed forward to the constraint engine $\mathcal{C}$. They can also be used to interpret feedback via $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$, allowing beliefs to reconfigure conceptual space over time.

### 2.7.5 Future Development

This morphism family opens up the possibility of:
- Learning-based morphism selection based on $\tau$
- Multi-agent disagreement modeling via conceptual divergence
- Conceptual morphism DSLs or schematic stacks for agent types

For the formal semantics of fuzzy star-shaped concepts and their operations, see:  
Bechberger & Kühnberger (2019), *Formalizing Conceptual Spaces with Fuzzy Star-Shaped Sets*.

## 2.8 Triadic Commitment and Agentive Alignment

To clarify the structure of belief projection and rhetorical resolution, we now integrate the triadic agent model:
$$
\mathcal{P} = (\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})
$$
Where:
- $\mathcal{S}$: the subject or emitter — the agent initiating closure or belief commitment
- $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$: the addressee — the pragmatically inferred or explicit recipient of interpretation or action
- $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$: the referent — the agent or entity being modeled, interpreted, or committed to in belief space

This structure makes each projection not just a belief, but an act of situated semantic address.

### 2.8.1 Projection as Triadic Commit

Belief projection becomes triad-specific:
$$
\mathcal{C}(\Omega) = \hat{\mathcal{A}}_{\mathcal{S} \to \bar{\mathcal{A}}}
$$
This expresses the full rhetorical force of a commitment:
- Who committed (emitter: $\mathcal{S}$)
- Toward whom (addressee: $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$)
- About what (referent: $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$)

This is essential for:
- Dialogue modeling
- Agentive inference under ambiguity
- Tracking multi-agent resolution dynamics

### 2.8.2 KAI in Triadic Form

To support alignment and epistemic coherence, we define the triadic KAI tuple:
$$
\text{KAI}_{\mathcal{P}} = \left( \text{KAI}(\hat{\mathcal{A}}), \text{KAI}(\bar{\mathcal{A}}), \text{KAI}(\mathcal{S}) \right)
$$
Where:
- $\text{KAI}(\hat{\mathcal{A}})$ measures irreducibility of the referent
- $\text{KAI}(\bar{\mathcal{A}})$ measures the salience of communicative force  
	_(e.g., pragmatic pressure on the addressee — how strongly the utterance "lands")_
- $\text{KAI}(\mathcal{S})$ measures closure pressure or commitment threshold of the emitter

This supports a formal notion of triadic alignment:

#### Definition: KAI Alignment

Let $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ be triadic configurations projected by different agents from the same region $\Omega \subset \mathcal{F}$. Define the KAI alignment distance:
$$
d_{\text{KAI}}(\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2) = \left\| \text{KAI}_{\mathcal{P}_1} - \text{KAI}_{\mathcal{P}_2} \right\|
$$
>_All KAI values are assumed normalised to a shared metric space to ensure comparability across agents._

Then:
- Low $d_{\text{KAI}}$ indicates interpretive alignment
- High $d_{\text{KAI}}$ signals divergence in referential modeling, addressability, or emission force

This metric can be used to:
- Trigger clarification morphisms
- Detect emergent narrative conflict
- Optimise multi-agent rhetorical flow

### 2.8.3 Action as Triadic Projection

When an action morphism becomes viable:
$$
\phi \cdot \nabla R > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{Act}^\dagger = 1
$$
We now interpret this as a triadic projection:
- $\mathcal{S}$ initiates closure (e.g. speaks, moves, declares)
- $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$ is explicitly or implicitly addressed
- $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$ is committed as the referent of belief

This gives each act semantic depth and narrative structure.

### 2.8.4 Implications for TRL and Morphisms

- $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ may prioritise contradiction chains based on triadic narrative salience
- Constraint morphisms $\pi_i$ can now be indexed by triadic configuration:
  
#### Constraint Morphism Naming Style
  $$
  \pi_i^{(\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})} : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}'
  $$
_Example:_  
$$
\pi_{\text{pol}}^{(\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})} \text{ increases commitment pressure when } \bar{\mathcal{A}} = \hat{\mathcal{A}}, \text{ and dampens it when they diverge.}
$$

- This enables agent-specific rhetorical behaviour, dialogue modeling, and story-consistent belief trajectories

### 2.9 Surprise-Driven Recognition ⬡[PV-surp]

> Proposition.  
> A region of the semantic manifold that persistently resists predictive traversal
> must be treated as emanating from an irreducible source (proto-agent).

#### 2.9.1 Surprise Field  
Let the prediction error tensor be  
$$
\Sigma(x,t)\;=\;\|\; \nabla_t R(x) \;-\; \widehat{\nabla_t R}(x)\;\|
$$  
where $\widehat{\nabla_t R}$ is the TRL-inf forecast.

Define the surprise scalar  
$$
S(x,t)\;=\;\sigma\bigl(\Sigma(x,t) - \vartheta\bigr)\in[0,1],
$$  
with $\vartheta$ a tolerance threshold and $\sigma$ a logistic squash.

#### 2.9.2 Recognition Operator  
Given a region $\Omega\subset\mathcal F$ with mean surprise  
$\overline{S}(\Omega)=\tfrac{1}{|\Omega|}\!\int_{\Omega}S$,  
and anchoring mass $\overline{\mathcal M}_{\text{anchor}}(\Omega)$,  
define  
$$
\boxed{\;
\mathcal R_\mu(\Omega)\;=\;\begin{cases}
\hat{\mathcal A}_{\text{pseudo}} & 
      \text{if }\overline{S}(\Omega)\,>\, \tau_S
      \;\wedge\;
      \overline{\mathcal M}_{\text{anchor}}(\Omega)\,>\,\mu,\\[6pt]
\varnothing & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}}
$$  
$\hat{\mathcal A}_{\text{pseudo}}$ is a *minimal explanatory agent vector* retained in
$\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ for further testing; no belief-space projection occurs yet.

*Interpretation.*  
$\mathcal R_\mu$ formalises “fail → model → probe”.  
If the environment deformation fails to smooth out *and* anchoring mass
indicates ongoing warp, the engine instantiates a speculative agent trace.

#### 2.9.3 Surprise Morphism  
A new constraint morphism  
$$
\pi_{\text{surp}} : (\mathcal F,\mathcal C)\;\longrightarrow\;\mathcal C
$$  
acts by:

1. calling $\mathcal R_\mu$ on high-surprise zones delivered by TRL-inf;  
2. inflating local closure pressure around $\hat{\mathcal A}_{\text{pseudo}}$  
   (increases $\Xi$ weight by factor $\lambda_{\text{surp}}>1$);  
3. registering $\hat{\mathcal A}_{\text{pseudo}}$ in the narrative trace $\tau$  
   for future anchoring-mass accumulation.

Compositional position in the stack:  
$$
\text{CMS}_{\text{⋯}} \;=\; \pi_{\text{actional}}\circ
                          \pi_{\text{surp}}\circ
                          \pi_{\text{qual}}\circ\cdots
$$

#### 2.9.4 Effect on Modulation Kernel  
When $\pi_{\text{surp}}$ elevates a pseudo-agent to *recognized*,
the Agent-Level Modulation Kernel ⬡[PV3.4] is spawned with initial parameters
$$
\mathcal M_{\text{agent}}^{(0)} = 
      \bigl(\gamma\!=\!0,\;
             \tau\!=\!0,\;
             \phi\!\parallel\!\nabla R,\;
             \rho_{\text{meta}}\approx 1\bigr).
$$
Thus recognition is *field-internal*; belief projection (§1.3.4) only fires
if subsequent closure conditions are met.

## 2.10 Anchoring Mass and Agent Compatibility in $\mathcal{F}$ ⬡[PV3.6]

This section introduces a set of scalar field operators that express metaphysical irreducibility and agent compatibility directly within the semantic manifold $\mathcal{F}$. These operators serve as diagnostics for rhetorical resolution strategies and enable field-level evaluation of agent distinctiveness, residual autonomy, and coalition potential — without requiring immediate projection into belief space $\mathcal{B}$.

### 2.10.1 Metaphysical Anchoring Operator

We define the anchoring mass of a semantic trace at point $x$ as:

$$
\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}(x) = \sigma\left( 
\underbrace{\left\| \nabla_t R(x) \right\|}_{\text{prospective deformation}} 
- 
\lambda \underbrace{\left\| \mathcal{C}(\Xi)(x) \right\|}_{\text{projected capture}} 
\right)
$$

- $\nabla_t R(x)$: expected future deformation of the concern field at $x$
- $\mathcal{C}(\Xi)(x)$: contradiction at $x$ already absorbed into $\mathcal{B}$
- $\sigma$: logistic squashing to $[0,1]$
- $\lambda$: balance parameter controlling conservatism

Interpretation: $\mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}(x) \approx 1$ means the field is still carrying surprise at $x$, making it metaphysically *live*; $\approx 0$ means the field's content has already been projected and absorbed — no further agentic distinction remains.


### 2.10.2 Compressibility-Compatibility Between Agents

Given anchoring maps from two agent-traces $\hat{\mathcal{A}}_i$ and $\hat{\mathcal{A}}_j$, define their compressibility-compatibility ratio at $x$ as:

$$
\chi_{ij}(x) = \frac{\min\left( \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(i)}(x), \, \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(j)}(x) \right)}{\max\left( \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(i)}(x), \, \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}^{(j)}(x) \right)}
$$

Define a higher-order coordinating agent:

$$
\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{sup}} = \left\{ x \in \mathcal{F} \; \middle| \; \chi_{ij}(x) > \tau_\chi \text{ for some } i,j \right\}
$$

This defines a semantic Markov blanket for partial accord: a region of field space where agent projections can coordinate without collapsing their distinctiveness.



### 2.10.3 Residual Irreducibility Metric ⬡PV9.8

Define a residual metric over an agent's Markov blanket:

$$
\rho_{\text{meta}}(\hat{\mathcal{A}}) = \int_{\text{MB}(\hat{\mathcal{A}})} \left( 1 - \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}(x) \right) \, dx
$$

This gives a total measure of *unassimilated agency* inside the projected envelope:

- Low $\rho_{\text{meta}}$: the agent has rendered itself legible
- High $\rho_{\text{meta}}$: the agent retains hidden capacity or irreducible pressure


### 2.10.4 Rhetorical and Strategic Implications

These field-level diagnostics allow a constraint engine to:

- Estimate how much of an agent remains ontologically opaque
- Determine whether collaboration implies erasure
- Calibrate resolution strategies $\pi_i$ based on residual metaphysical pressure

Agents with high $\rho_{\text{meta}}$ may resist certain rhetorical priors (e.g., $\pi_{\text{def}}$ or $\pi_{\text{min}}$), while shared anchoring across agents (high $\chi_{ij}$) justifies the formation of temporary accord zones or joint commitments in $\mathcal{B}$.

These metrics support a new class of strategic resolution morphisms:

$$
\pi_{\text{meta}}: (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{M}_{\text{anchor}}, \rho_{\text{meta}}) \to \delta \mathcal{C}
$$

...which enable context-sensitive modulation of $\mathcal{C}$ based on projected irreducibility and cooperation compatibility.

### 2.11 Pre-Agentive Teleological Structure

In the Semantic Agency Architecture, a distinction is made between agentive teleology and pre-agentive teleological structure.

Pre-agentive teleology refers to the way that tensions, contradictions, and relevance gradients in the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$ tend naturally toward resolution, without requiring the presence of explicit agents.

This structure is not intentional in the belief-space sense. It is not guided by goals, preferences, or subjective desires.  
Instead, it arises from the intrinsic geometry of the field: contradictions create pressure, pressures induce flows, and flows trace paths toward local coherence.

Thus, the teleological vector field $\phi$ exists already in $\mathcal{F}$, even before any agentic closure has formed. It represents the "natural working out" of semantic deformation—an unfolding tendency of meaning to resolve itself, driven by the local structure of contradiction, curvature, and concern.

We define the **Pre-Agentive Teleological Vector Field** formally as:

$$
\phi_{\text{pre}}(x) \;:=\; -\nabla \Xi(x) + \nabla \mathcal{E}(x)
$$

where:
- $\Xi(x)$ is the local contradiction tensor at point $x$,
- $\mathcal{E}(x)$ is the informational density or entropy at $x$.

This vector field encodes the *pressure to resolve contradiction* and the *pull toward locally coherent, lower-entropy states*.

When agentive closure occurs—meaning an agent emerges by satisfying closure conditions—then $\phi$ becomes aligned with an internal agentic structure, and projects intentional action.  
Before closure, $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ simply describes the "latent directionality" of semantic flow.

#### Interpretation

- Pre-agentive teleology is **not** a belief or a goal.
- It **is** an emergent tendency structured by the field itself.
- Agents, when they form, **appropriate** $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ and **bend** it toward specific teleological action.

Thus, the architecture posits that meaning has *an immanent rationality* even before the existence of subjects or agents. Resolution pressure exists first; intentional agency arises later by **selectively coupling** to these pressures.

#### Summary

| Element | Pre-Agentive Teleology |
| --- | --- |
| Exists in | $\mathcal{F}$ only |
| Driven by | Contradiction and entropy gradients |
| Result | Tendency toward local resolution |
| No agent yet | No commitment to belief or subjective goal |
| Agents | Emerge by coupling to $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ and stabilizing closure |

    - $\pi_{\text{sym}}$​: preserve symmetrical ambiguity
    - $\pi_{\text{min}}$​: minimise closure size
    - $\pi_{\text{teleo}}$ ​: maximise alignment with $\phi$

#### 6. Constraint Geometry and Semantic Topology
- How priors induce topological signatures:
    - Warping closure basins
    - Raising/lowering curvature thresholds
    - Generating stable attractors vs. deferrals
- Visualisations or analogies: rhetorical priors as _semantic weather patterns_

#### 7. Examples and Interpretive Dynamics
- Agent encountering a contradiction: different priors yield different belief commitments or actions
- Multi-agent interpretation under distinct priors: disagreement as differential resolution geometry
- Rhetorical priors as interpretive personalities

#### 8. Toward a Logic of Rhetorical Flow
- Can these priors compose, commute, or contradict?
- Might they form a category, topos, or sheaf over $\mathcal{F}$?
- Interaction with narrative trace τ\tauτ and concern tensor $R$

#### 9. Conclusion: Expressiveness Beyond Propositions
- Rhetorical priors allow systems to deliberate, not just infer
- They give interpretive form to semantic collapse
- They are a basis for a constraint-based rhetoric, suitable for agentive systems embedded in open worlds

## Appendix A: Architectural Assumptions (v1.2.1)

This appendix formally enumerates the structural assumptions upon which this document depends. They define the valid operational space for the constraint satisfaction engine, the rhetorical strategies $\pi_i$, and the full resolution chain from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{B}$.

### Core Architectural Entities

- $\mathcal{F}$: The fuzzy semantic manifold — a high-dimensional tensor space encoding distributed meaning, salience, and contradiction.
- TRL: Tensor Resolution Layer — a non-destructive traversal system that prepares $\mathcal{F}$ for projection by surfacing contradictions and simplifying topological structure.
- $\mathcal{C}$: The constraint satisfaction engine — the core system that resolves contradictions, computes closure, and projects results into $\mathcal{B}$. It is embedded with rhetorical priors $\pi_i$.
- $\mathcal{B}$: The belief space — a space of propositional commitments, agentive models, and probabilistic inferences.
- $\pi_i$: Rhetorical resolution priors — modular operators that guide the behaviour of $\mathcal{C}$ under contradiction.

| (P1)   | $\mathcal{C} : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ is a structured functor mapping semantic closures to beliefs.                                                                                                                                                          |
| (P2)   | Compression failure triggers projection: if $$\kappa + \Xi + \mathcal{E} > \theta$$, closure occurs.                                                                                                                                                               |
| (P3)   | Constraint satisfaction is directional: guided by the teleological vector $\phi$ and concern field $R$.                                                                                                                                                            |
| (P4)   | Rhetorical priors $\pi_i$ are embedded in $\mathcal{C}$ and modulate resolution behaviour under contradiction.                                                                                                                                                     |
| (P5)   | Semantic closures update the narrative trace $\tau$ recursively.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| (P6)   | A partial inverse $$\mathcal{C}^{-1} : \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{F}$$ allows reprojection from belief to meaning.                                                                                                                                                   |
| (P7)   | A Tensor Resolution Layer (TRL) operates prior to $\mathcal{C}$ and prepares $\mathcal{F}$ by exposing latent contradictions and simplifying configuration.                                                                                                        |
| (P8)   | $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ performs semantic traversal and amplification of $\mathcal{F}$ using contradiction traces $\Xi$, curvature $\kappa$, concern $R$, and narrative history $\tau$. It prepares regions for resolution but does not perform projection itself. |

| (P2)       | No compression threshold                    | Collapse logic undefined; $\mathcal{B}$ underdefined                                                                |

| (P6)       | No reprojection                             | No feedback from action to meaning; semantic field decouples                                                        |
| (P7)       | $\text{TRL}$ misconfigured or absent        | High-dimensional contradictions remain latent; resolution becomes noisy or unreliable                               |
| (P8)       | $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ removed or weakened | System becomes unable to prepare semantic material for projection; resolution becomes brittle, ungrounded, or noisy |

> Changes to any of these assumptions require a re-audit of all $\pi_i$ definitions and the validity of the constraint-resolution strategies described herein. The TRL is especially critical for ensuring that $\mathcal{C}$ operates on a simplified, contradiction-aware subset of $\mathcal{F}$.
