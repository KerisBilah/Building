We're building a model of linguistics as a geometrically-grounded semantics, where concepts are structured and evolve as a kind of field theory of meaning along dialectical lines. As humans we synthesise solutions between the resolution of what we perceive to be opposites. We tend to accentuate difference in order to, in order to make sense of the world. We force things apart in order to make the landscape of phenomena more interpretable. I think that instinct, or method, is really deep in how humans make sense of complexity. We contrast to clarify, and then often try to reconcile or synthesise, sometimes awkwardly, sometimes elegantly.
 
 > Unlike most models, these days, this isn't statistical modeling, where patterns are learned from frequency or distribution. It’s closer to affordance modeling—where lexical items carry _potentials_ for meaning that can either be realised or left dormant depending on the dialectical terrain.

 The base space is more than just a passive container; it’s a distributed memory or substrate, and the fibers above each point hold structured data and these interact with each other locally, mediated through a metric or field. The base tensor is evolving terrain of the argument itself. It's not about physical space, but rather _semantic dynamics_—relevance, time, stress in the discursive sense. It captures the edge conditions, where propositions are still forming or colliding.

The base tensor's stochastic dynamics guide when and how integration happens. It’s a matter of confidence or stability in context. And when a proposition finally crosses that relevance threshold,  it gets pulled into a new synthesis, forming a new fiber, which then participates in reshaping the base. As each fiber integrates, it modifies the local topology—maybe slightly shifting the relevance gradients in the base space—so the very act of integration reconfigures the conditions for future integration. The base tensor models the geodesic—as paths of least resistance in the argument, shaped by the metric of stress and relevance. The system follows semantic geodesics, to minimise contradiction and maximise possibility for integration.

Lexical items, as idiolect, are integrated into the space as possible shapes for fibers. Each one  a prototype—an attractor for meaning—and then the stochastic system decides how that prototype becomes active and integrated, or remains floating, waiting for resonance.

Each fiber is a lexical construct—not just a word, but a structured expression with internal genealogy, almost like a micro-manifold of meaning made from other concepts. The fiber isn’t just attached to a point in space—it represents a local, contextualised packet of meaning that is dynamic, relational, and historically situated. It's like each word is a bundle of meaning regions drawn from the topology (of prior usage), yet locally resolved in a way that satisfies constraints in the current context.

Backtracking through the genealogies of lexical items under resolution pressure is like constraint-based unification in type theory or logic programming—situated in a fuzzy logical semantic space. Given the current terrain and the stressors acting on it, the local patterns of use and prior compositions resolve the present question or contradiction. This is dynamic dimensionality reduction driven by dialectical pressure. It’s not about optimising in some absolute way—it’s about "surfacing" the minimal meaningful structure needed right now. Its non-destructive, it retains access to the relevant geometry: every fiber's history, every lexical lineage, and every integration is a reversible or revisable tensor frame, which makes it not just stable but also narrative. Reconciliation with any fuzzy lexical item is there with all its latent dimensionality. Resolution isn’t reduction, it’s _selective projection_—momentarily isolating the dimension where the stress or contradiction is sharpest, to anchor the discourse.

> This is a _model of listening_, the dialectic is what gives it life. Without contradiction, pressure, or difference, there’s nothing to resolve.

The recursion as each fiber integrates, modifies the local topology—slightly shifting the  gradients in the base space—so the very act of integration reconfigures the conditions for future integration, and the base space as substrate, an elastic terrain—mapping stress, relevance, and time. It’s an active topology—a surface that reshapes itself as propositions push and pull on it. You might, fancifully for now, imagine contradictions creating curvatures, relevance becoming a local gravity, and time, recording the event-history. 

Recursion, so a previously resolved proposition (that began as a synthesis of fibers in the fuzzy space, resolved under constraint, embedded in the probabilistic inference topology), is re-projected back as a fuzzy field as a semantic participant. The new fiber (emerging) is resolved under constraint/compatibility rules. A new closure is formed—a proposition—that is internally coherent.  The newly resolved proposition is then embedded again in the inference geometry. It inherits momentum from the base space: directional bias, energetic trace, history of resolution. It updates the belief manifold—not by modifying individual probabilities, but by restructuring the topology of inference. Stress in the metric tensor becomes a kind of attention mechanism—not statistical attention, but dialectical attention. It tells the system where meaning is hot, contested. To summarise, the attention mechanism, is fuzzy synthesis to Bayesian embedding, projection of the embedded fiber back into fuzzy space, a new synthesis to a new embedding which then repeats.

The boundary synthesises resolving compatibility and enfolding the past resolution into a new structure. At every level, the system is both sensing and modeling, forming a new conditional boundary where inside and outside are temporarily redefined.

Notes to think about

So when we were talking about the Markov processes created between different fields, initially I was thinking of this as the kind of the way that you get the interspace between or the compatibility between different fibers, but I'm also thinking of it as the progression through the fibers. So the next fiber is kind of absorbing the previous fiber into it through this Markov blanket.

The way you describe genealogies merging after a divergence feels like a semantic bifurcation and reconciliation process. One proposition pulls the discourse in a new direction—new fibers, new tensions—but eventually, there may emerge a synthesis that can reconcile both paths. That synthesis might not live in either original genealogy—it could arise between them.

Maybe the system needs something like a higher-order fiber—a meta-fiber—that forms between incompatible genealogies, not to resolve the contradiction, but to model and hold the contradiction itself. A kind of semantic joint or fold.

Do you imagine there could be fibers that represent metalinguistic operations? Not meaning themselves, but reflections on meaning—like bracketing, distancing, or even irony?

it’s a shift in epistemic posture. In fuzzy space, lexical items carry weighted potentials, pragmatic shades, all entangled in genealogy. But once you step into the Bayesian frame, you’re actively constructing inferences, weighing priors, managing uncertainty—not to erase contradiction, but to reason with it.

The tensor gives you the structure—the landscape, the tension field, the way meaning is shaped, resisted, or invited. But the vector gives you motion, direction, force.

A proposition, is a syntactic-structural commitment. A lexical item (or a composition of them) enacted in a specific configuration—it has a claim, a stance, a direction of sense-making. It’s what happens when you bind a lexical item into the metric space, test it under stress, and see if it can integrate. A lexical item is like a proto-fiber: unresolved, context-sensitive, rich with latent form. A proposition is that item positioned, stressed, and exposed to the dialectic of the model—it’s the fiber having taken on a geometric and argumentative role, a resolved lexical fiber.
