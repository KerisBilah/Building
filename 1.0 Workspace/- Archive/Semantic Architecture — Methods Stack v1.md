## 1. Projection and Collapse Methods

### ⬡PV3.6 — Adaptive Spline Smoothing

Purpose: To regulate projection collapse sharpness and belief deformation sensitivity using a local smoothing penalty function $\lambda(p)$.

Formal Expression:

Let $\lambda(p)$ be defined as:

$$
\lambda(p) = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha d_R(p)}
$$

where:
- $d_R(p)$ is the local relevance distance in $\mathcal{F}$,
- $\alpha$ is a scaling constant tuning smoothing aggressiveness.

Statistical Realization:
- This corresponds to locally adaptive smoothing splines from nonparametric regression,
- In fuzzy-valued regions, implement via fuzzy spline regression to preserve modal uncertainty.

Interpretation:
- High-relevance zones yield low $\lambda(p)$ → sharp projection (collapse occurs easily),
- Low-relevance zones have high $\lambda(p)$ → projection is resisted, allowing semantic drift or scaffold formation.

Applied In:
- Constraint as Rhetoric ⬡[PV3.5]
- Rewriting Do-Calculus §3.1
- Affective modulation of closure thresholds

Engineering Note:
- Compatible with UCSE tensor sculpting (PTD), and may be composed with affective bias via $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$.


## 1.1 Adaptive Spline Smoothing  
⬡[PV3.6]

### Purpose
Regulate semantic field collapse sensitivity and projection sharpness by dynamically modulating the smoothing penalty $\lambda(p)$ based on relevance distance.

### Formal Expression

Local smoothing penalty function:

$$
\lambda(p) = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha d_R(p)}
$$

Where:
- $d_R(p)$ is the minimal relevance distance from $p$ to an agentic closure, semantic attractor, or warp in $\mathcal{F}$,
- $\alpha$ is a tunable steepness parameter controlling smoothing aggressiveness.

### Statistical Realisation

- Realised as locally adaptive spline smoothing in high-dimensional tensor fields.
- In fuzzy-valued regions, implement via fuzzy spline regression to preserve modal structure.
- Supports variable bandwidth smoothing across $\mathcal{F}$ based on salience.

### Interpretation

- High relevance ($d_R(p)\to 0$): $\lambda(p)\to 1$, minimal smoothing → fast closure.
- Low relevance ($d_R(p)\to\infty$): $\lambda(p)\to 0$, strong smoothing → delayed closure.
- Encourages stability and flexibility in semantically peripheral regions without rigidifying semantic centers.

### Applied In

- Constraint as Rhetoric — narrative closure dynamics (⬡[PV3.5])
- Rewriting Do-Calculus — topological intervention stability (§3)
- Affective Modulation — dynamic pressure adjustment via $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$

### Engineering Notes

- Composable with UCSE tensor sculpting: smoothing penalty can modulate PTD decomposition.
- Traversal layers (TRL-inf) should apply $\lambda(p)$ as a local adjustment during contradiction descent.
- Future versions may integrate spline basis adaptation tied to $\gamma$ (agentic mas

## 1.2 Reversible Semantic Traversal (TRL-inf)
⬡[PV3.0]

### Purpose
Enable reversible, bias-able traversal over the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$ for preparation, tension rehearsal, and rhetorical pre-shaping — without committing to belief projection.

### Formal Expression

Traversal proceeds by a staged elastic descent on contradiction gradients:

```pseudo
# TRL_inf – reversible semantic traversal
initialise state p ∈ 𝓕

while not closure_detected(p):
    grad ← -∇Ξ(p)                      # move downhill on contradiction
    grad ← grad + π_stack_bias(p)      # rhetorical priors bias flow
    if elastic_ok(grad):
        p ← p + α·grad                 # elastic step
    else:
        p ← backtrack(p)               # retract & try alternative path
end

return p
```

Where:

- $\Xi$ is the contradiction field,
- $\pi$ is the current rhetorical morphism stack bias,
- $\alpha$ is a traversal step-size parameter.

Traversal always preserves reversibility: no $\tau$ (narrative trace) is written during TRL-inf itself.

### Interpretation

- Elastic descent minimises contradiction while respecting rhetorical biases.
- Backtracking avoids traversing into local collapses or excessive curvature spikes.
- Sculpting and smoothing (e.g., UCSE or $\lambda(p)$) may adjust local traversal parameters dynamically.

### Applied In

- Constraint as Rhetoric — field preparation (§2.1–2.2)
- Rewriting Do-Calculus — semantic preconditioning for intervention (§2.0–§3.0)
- Unified Constraint Satisfaction Engine (UCSE) — integration during Tensor Sculptor phase.

### Engineering Notes

- Affective modulation kernels $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$ can inject dynamic traversal biases (fear, irritation, excitement).
- Traversal automatically supports rhetorical priors (π-stack) as reversible diffeomorphisms on $\mathcal{F}$.
- No projection to $\mathcal{B}$ occurs until constraint collapse threshold $\theta$ is crossed.

## 1.3 UCSE Tensor Sculptor ($\mathcal{U}$)
⬡[PV3.0], ⬡[PV3.9]

### Purpose
To dynamically refine the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$ by applying non-destructive, localised tensor transformations that clarify contradictions, remove noise, and scaffold expressive resolution — without forcing projection.

UCSE is a core semantic preparation layer in the architecture, enabling belief readiness, rhetorical modulation, and agentive emergence.

### Formal Definition

Let:
$$
\mathcal{U} : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}'
$$

Where $\mathcal{F}'$ is a semantically sculpted version of $\mathcal{F}$, altered only by:

1. Partial Tucker Decomposition (PTD)  
   Reduces noisy modes in high-dimensional tensors via:
   $$
   \mathcal{T}' = \text{PTD}(\mathcal{T}, \{r_i\})
   $$
   preserving dominant field dimensions (modes of concern, contradiction, closure curvature).

2. Voronoi Partitioning (Semantic Voronoi Tessellation)  
   Divides $\mathcal{F}$ into relevance-similar zones using field metrics (e.g., $\nabla R$), enabling context-aware smoothing.

3. Contradiction Marking  
   Identifies latent contradiction gradients $\Xi(x)$ where $\|\Xi(x)\|$ exceeds ambient average + deviation buffer:
   $$
   x \mapsto \text{marked if } \|\Xi(x)\| > \mathbb{E}[\|\Xi\|] + \sigma_{\Xi}
   $$

4. Lightweight Scaffold Layer  
   Builds temporary closure-ready zones $\Omega_s$ where partial narrative conditions apply:
   $$
   \Xi < \epsilon_\Xi, \quad \kappa + \mathcal{E} > \theta_{\text{scaf}} < \theta
   $$


### Interpretation

- Tensor sculpting enables rhetorical priors to act on semantically breathable material.
- The sculpted $\mathcal{F}'$ retains trace continuity and projection compatibility.
- UCSE *does not* cause belief projection — it prepares the semantic substrate so that resolution (when triggered) is coherent and narratively viable.

### Applied In

- Constraint as Rhetoric §2.3–2.4: semantic preparation and rhetorical traceability
- Foundational Priors v2.3 ⬡[PV3.0], ⬡[PV3.9]
- Rewriting Do-Calculus §1.3 and §2.0: projection filtering and resolution shaping
- Affective modulation preprocessing (via $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$)

### Engineering Notes

- PTD is performed *locally* on relevance-weighted regions; integrates with $\lambda(p)$ smoothing to protect against collapse outside of agentic zones.
- Modular implementation allows independent scheduling of sculptor passes.
- Field transitions $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}'$ are logged at meta-layer for reversibility tracking.

> Insight:  
> Without $\mathcal{U}$, rhetorical morphisms may misfire on chaotic tensor noise. UCSE ensures semantic geometry becomes interpretable and traversable before π-stack bias acts.
