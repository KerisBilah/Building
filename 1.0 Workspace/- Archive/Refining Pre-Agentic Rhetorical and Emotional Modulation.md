### Goal
Formally integrate rhetorical modulation (constraint selector strategies) and emotional modulation (concern field deformation) as structured, pre-agentic control layers over the semantic manifold $\mathcal{F}$.


### Plan Outline

#### 1. Formalise Rhetorical Priors as a Modulation Sheaf
- Define a modulation sheaf over $\mathcal{F}$:
  - Local sections are constraint morphism selectors (rhetorical strategies).
  - Fallacies (e.g., strawman, false dichotomy) treated as field-deforming operators.
  - Must preserve compositionality within UCSE cycles.
  
#### 2. Build Typology: Fallacy-as-Constraint Modulation
- Create a table mapping classical fallacies to:
  - Their field modulation effect,
  - Their constraint resolution bias,
  - Their semantic side-effects (e.g., hidden contradiction accumulation).

#### 3. Formalise Emotional Modulation as Tensor Field Operators
- Define emotional operators $\mathcal{M}_{\text{affect}}$ as local relevance dampers or amplifiers:
  - Gain/damping of $\nabla R$.
  - Cybernetic control of urgency and interpretive drift.
  
#### 4. Integrate Rhetorical and Emotional Modulation into Constraint Cycle
- Position modulation stages in the UCSE workflow:
  - Before closure attempts (biases selection),
  - During PTD / Voronoi processing (weights local transitions).

### Key Outputs
- Formal definition of modulation sheaf structure.
- Typology of rhetorical fallacies as constraint modulation.
- Emotional modulation operators over $\mathcal{F}$.
- Updated UCSE diagram including modulation phase.

---

### Notes
- This respects and enriches the original architecture of pre-agentic semantic drift.
- Provides clear scaffolding for emergence of rhetorical individuality before agentic closure.
- Modular, composable, category-respecting.
