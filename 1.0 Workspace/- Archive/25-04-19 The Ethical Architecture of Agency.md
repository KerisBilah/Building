# The Ethical Architecture of Agency

## On Irreducibility and Subjectivity

### Two Kinds of Irreducibility

| Type | Description | Compressible? |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Situational Irreducibility | Temporary divergence — high KAI due to partial model failure | Yes |
| Ontological Irreducibility | Structural residue — the agent as subject | No |

Even if agentic fragments converge internally, the **emitter** of concern remains irreducible.



## Kantian Grounding

- Subjects are **ends in themselves**
- The origin of projection ($\mathcal{S}$) is not reducible to any model
- No semantic representation grants **access to subjectivity**

### Claim

$$
\text{Modeling behavior} \neq \text{Modeling being}
$$

Agenthood is:
- Epistemic (via $\delta$, KAI)
- Stochastic (via irreducibility metrics)
- Ontological (via residual term $\eta$)



## Triadic Agent Grammar

We define a minimal palette of agency:

$$
\mathcal{P} = (\mathcal{S}, \bar{\mathcal{A}}, \hat{\mathcal{A}})
$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{S}$: Subject / emitter
- $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$: Addressee / pragmatic target
- $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$: Referent / modeled agent

Each has:
- A point of view
- A locus of concern
- A position in the manifold $\mathcal{M}$



## Ethical Implication

Even when $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$ is perfectly modelled:

- $\gamma, \tau, \phi$ may align  
- $\delta \to 0$  
- But $$\eta \neq 0$$

Because **the agent is more than the model of its behaviour**.

### Ethical Principle

> No amount of inference permits possession of the subject.  
> Agenthood is not only a modeling failure, but an ontological stance.



## Application in Dialogue

In any act of utterance:

- $\mathcal{S}$ speaks
- To $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$
- About $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$

All three are projected, entangled, and ethically distinct.

This gives a foundation for:
- Dialogue modeling
- Ethical interaction
- Semantic responsibility
