## Identify Core Visual Targets
### 1. Visual Modeling and Communicability Strategy

This section defines how core mathematical structures in the semantic agency architecture should be visualized, navigated, and communicated. It complements the validation system by making claims intelligible, not just auditable.

### 1.1 Core Visual Targets

The following elements require structured visual unpacking:

| Concept / Operator            | Recommended Form             | Purpose                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Closure Condition             | Flowchart / Decision Tree     | Shows threshold crossing as decision    |
| Cone of Concern               | Force field diagram           | Shows bounded attention/action space    |
| Projection Functor $\mathcal{C}$ | Categorical morphism diagram  | Expresses semantic → belief collapse    |
| KAI (Kolmogorov Action Index) | Entropy-vs-program-length graph | Illustrates compression pressure        |
| CMS (Constraint Morphism Stack) | Stack flow / morphism pipeline | Shows modulated resolution dynamics     |
| $\tau$ (Narrative Trace)      | Stateflow or warp trail map   | Visualizes continuity across closure    |

#### 1.2 Visual Language Principles

- Topological Instead of Syntactic:  
  Favour spatial, field-like representations over symbolic logic trees.

- Temporal Flows:  
  When showing narrative dynamics (e.g., $\tau$, morphism sequences), use arrows, phase transitions, or animated layering.

- Modality-Based Colouring:  
  Use colour coding to distinguish:
  - Relevance fields ($R$)
  - Teleological flow ($\phi$)
  - Contradiction ($\Xi$)
  - Closure zones
  - Agentive projection

- Layered Explanations:  
  Every diagram should optionally be decomposable — from high-level intuition to formal composition.

#### 1.3 Standard Diagram Types

| Type            | Use Case                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Flowcharts   | Threshold logic (e.g. closure formation)     |
| Vector Fields| Attention, affordance, teleological guidance |
| Mesh Overlays| Contradiction zones in $\mathcal{F}$         |
| Morphism Pipes | Constraint modulation (e.g. $\pi_i$ stack)  |
| Narrative Warps | Trace of $\tau$ over time or space         |

#### 1.4 Where to drop the diagrams

The SVGs / mermaid blocks

1. `/visual/` folder (or `/_fig`)  
    _File naming pattern:_  
    `xxxxxxxx_vx_xxxx-xx-xx.svg`
    
2. At the very top of each diagram note, start with:
    
    `--- diagram-for: xxxxxxxx pv-source : PV2.1 version   : v1 created   : xxxx-xx-xx ---`
    
    That gives us machine hooks (`diagram-for` + `pv-source`) so Docs-build can automatically embed the latest diagram wherever `{{fig:cone-of-concern}}` appears.
    
3. In _Foundational Priors_ you’ll simply write:
    
    `{{fig:cone-of-concern}}`
    
    and the static-site generator (or a lite Obsidian Templater macro) will inline the up-to-date SVG.
