# First Publication and Build Checklist
title: Semantic Agency Architecture — Project Checklist v0.1
author: Bee
status: draft
created: 2025-04-28

## I. Preparation Stage

- [ ] Clean and modularize key documents:
  - [ ] Foundational Priors v2.2 (Theory Anchor)
  - [ ] Unified Constraint Satisfaction Engine (Core Mechanism)
  - [ ] Modular Epistemology for Engineering Modules (Engineering Anchor)
- [ ] Minor edits:
  - [ ] Add short abstracts at the top of each document.
  - [ ] Standardize metadata blocks (titles, aliases, tags, related).
- [ ] Decide on first public version numbers (v1.0 for papers? v0.1 for engineering?).

---

## II. Repository Creation

- [ ] Create GitHub organization: `semantic-agency-architecture`
- [ ] Create first repository:
  - [ ] `/theory/` folder (Markdown or LaTeX)
  - [ ] `/engineering/` folder (Rust prototypes, specs)
  - [ ] `/docs/` folder (Project overview, onboarding guide)
- [ ] Initialize Git with clean structure and README.

---

## III. First Public Archive

- [ ] Prepare first "Theory v1.0" bundle:
  - [ ] Compile Foundational Priors, UCSE, and Epistemology docs into a release zip.
- [ ] Upload release to Zenodo (free archiving) and generate DOI.
- [ ] Tag GitHub release with the DOI.

---

## IV. Engineering Playground (Parallel)

- [ ] Set up Rust workspace:
  - [ ] Basic Tensor Field Manager (TFM) skeleton.
  - [ ] Dummy Constraint Activation Layer (CAL) — even just a mockup.
  - [ ] Simple test runners for field mutation.
- [ ] Write clean, minimal README:
  - [ ] "This is a playground, not a production engine yet."

---

## V. Outreach Seed

- [ ] Write a short "Origin and Intention" piece (2–3 paragraphs):
  - [ ] What the project is.
  - [ ] Why it matters.
  - [ ] Why it's open to others.
- [ ] Optional: lightweight site (e.g., MkDocs, Obsidian Publish) summarizing:
  - [ ] Project overview
  - [ ] Key documents
  - [ ] How to explore or get involved.

# Note:
This checklist is alive.  
We'll treat it like a growing field — adding, pruning, harvesting as needed.
