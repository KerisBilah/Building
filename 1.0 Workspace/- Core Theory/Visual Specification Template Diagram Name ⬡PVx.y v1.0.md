This diagram illustrates the bidirectional role of the projection functor $\mathcal{C}$ and its inverse $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$, situating belief not as a terminus but a phase in a cyclic process.

- Beliefs ($\hat{\mathcal{A}}, b$) are formed as compressive closures of irreducible zones in $\mathcal{F}$.
- Yet, when agents act, reason, or speak, those beliefs must be expanded back into semantic material.
- $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ is the mechanism of semantic reconstitution — a kind of topological “memory trace” that pushes back into the relevance field.

This one could be a good candidate for animation later: visualising how increasing $\kappa$, $\Xi$, or $\mathcal{E}$ over time pushes the surface past $\theta$ — and a "rupture" (closure) occurs.

We’ll want to show multiple closures in one field, each with its own $\tau$ trailing back and a distinct $\eta$ (perhaps small “crystal-like” nodules that remain irreducible even when the tension is released).

| Colour Used                | Yes      | Each agent/belief trace a different hue                                                                                          |
| Cross-section              | No       | Probably not required                                                                                                            |
| Isometric / Perspective    | No       | Slight isometric for spatial feel or flat for clarity                                                                            |
| Warp / Deformation Visible | No       | Paths bend more with higher $\Xi$ or $\mathcal{E}$                                                                               |
| Dynamic Flow / Vectors     | Optional | Could annotate gradient directions to show rising semantic tension                                                               |
| Analogy                    |          | Think of geodesic deviation — where two "paths" (semantic closures or belief projections) curve apart under different pressures. |

This is a Divergence field / distance diagram
Structure: Multiple semantic regions or agent traces (e.g., $\mathcal{P}_1$, $\mathcal{P}_2$), each with its own projected belief kernel or closure.  Encoding: Distance between these projections in KAI space is plotted as $d_{\text{KAI}}(\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2)$.  The diagram shows two (or more) agentive projection paths, beginning from similar starting points in $\mathcal{F}$ and curving toward distinct belief regions in $\mathcal{B}$. As they curve, we annotate:  their KAI scores at closure (a measure of irreducibility); the difference between them as a divergence index. The higher the $d_{\text{KAI}}$, the more semantically irreconcilable or misaligned the agents/beliefs are.
