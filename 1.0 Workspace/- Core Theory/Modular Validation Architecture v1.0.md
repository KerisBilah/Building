# Modular Validation Architecture
⬡[TV-Core]

> Architectural Dependency Notice  
> This module is designed to complement but remain independent from [[Modular Epistemology v1.0]].
>  
> All Modular Theory documents must pass relevant theoretical validation tests (⬡[TVx.y]) before being marked stable.

## 1.1 Motivating Intuition 
⬡[TV0.1]

Theory is structure under compression.  
But just as software needs tests to guard against silent regressions, theory needs tests to guard against silent contradictions, broken mappings, and misplaced metaphors.

This Validation Architecture ensures that:
- Formal operators preserve intended object types.
- Constraint flows remain well-formed under morphisms.
- Field operations respect theoretical ground rules (e.g., semantic continuity, curvature modulation).
- No symbolic shortcut masks structural incoherence.

We treat theoretical tests the same way robust engineering treats software tests:  
- Every test has a minimal assertion.
- Tests can be targeted by document and PV section.
- Tests can evolve — deprecated tests are tracked historically.

Test tags are:  
⬡[TVx.y] — Theory Validation.


## 1.2 Test Structure

Each Validation Test has:

| Field | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| Test ID | Unique tag: ⬡[TVx.y] |
| Test Name | Human-readable name |
| Assertion | What must always be true |
| Expected Form | Canonical acceptable form |
| Violation Pattern | Known error types or deformation risks |
| Rationale | Why this constraint matters |
| Status | In-progress / Stable / Deprecated |



# 2. Theory Validation Tests



## 2.1 Test ⬡[TV1.1] — Constraint Mediation in Field Modulation

| Field | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Test ID | ⬡[TV1.1] |
| Test Name | Constraint Mediation in Field Modulation |
| Assertion | Field modulation operators (e.g., rhetorical priors $\pi_i$) must be constraint-mediated, not direct field overrides. |
| Expected Form | A modulation operator $f_{\pi_i}$ must satisfy:  
$$
f_{\pi_i} : (\mathcal{F},\mathcal{C}) \to \mathcal{C}
$$  
Modifications to fields like $\Xi, \kappa, R$ must be mediated via constraint transformations, not as direct replacements. |
| Violation Pattern | Any expression suggesting:  
$$
f_{\pi_i}^*(\Xi, \kappa, R) = (\Xi', \kappa', R')
$$  
where $f_{\pi_i}^*$ appears to override field values without passing through constraint mediation. |
| Rationale | The architecture defines all semantic field deformation as constraint-driven. Direct override would break closure detection, warp traceability, and modular epistemology assumptions (⬡[PV1.3], ⬡[PV2.2], ⬡[PV3.1]). |
| Status | Stable |



# 3. Validation Summary Table

| Test ID | Name | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ⬡[TV1.1] | Constraint Mediation in Field Modulation | Stable |

# 4. Future Expansion

New theoretical tests will be added as:
- New modules introduce novel formal operations,
- More subtle risks (e.g., projection layer confusion, closure condition violations) are identified,
- Engineering implementation hints uncover latent structural risks.

Every major PV section should eventually map to a TV matrix, ensuring theoretical integrity at both document and system levels.


> ⬡[TV-Core]: Validation is not just about formal correctness — it is about preserving the semantic tension that agency itself depends on.

> A theory that cannot surprise itself under its own constraints is not a theory — it is a dead system.
