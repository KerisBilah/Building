## 3 Version & PV alignment checklist

| Item | Current draft | Needs change? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Front-matter `related:` links | v1.2.1 → v2.1 | Yes |
| In-text PV refs | none / old | Yes – add per §5 |
| Appendix assumption codes | (P1)… | Replace with PV tags or drop (we keep YAML) |
| Any *new* operator (e.g. Surprise Morphism) | not in PV spec | Add as PV3.5+ in Appendix A and Foundational Priors |


## 4 Suggested workflow

1. Paste the scaffold into Obsidian & move old prose into the marked slots.  
2. Tag while you paste — it’s faster than a later sweep.  
3. Run your Dataview grep for `⬡[PV` to verify every tag resolves.  
4. Bump versions only if you touch the YAML *definitions* (content changes), not just prose.  
5. Ping me when you hit a place where a claim feels hard to tag — that’s usually a sign the theory needs an extra PV entry or more precise linkage.


### A couple of open questions for you

1. Audience granularity – do you want the “Extended Development” (§8) to stay as deep-dive math, or split into a companion note for newcomers?  
2. PV for surprise/anchoring metrics – shall we mint a new PV *family* (e.g. PV5.x “diagnostic fields”) or tuck them under PV3.x as advanced morphisms?  
3. Diagram policy – you said no self-generated images but you *do* reference visual assets; would a SageMath script generating a simple curvature-threshold heat-map be useful here?

Let me know, and I’ll iterate with you on the next draft!
