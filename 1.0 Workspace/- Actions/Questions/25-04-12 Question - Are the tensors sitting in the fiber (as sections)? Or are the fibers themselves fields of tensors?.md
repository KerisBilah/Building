#### Option 1: Tensors as Sections of Fibers

- Here, each fiber is a space, and the tensor is a section—a specific element that lives in that fiber, corresponding to a particular base point.
- Think of this like:

> At a given location in the base space (e.g., a relevance-weighted context), the fiber contains possible meanings of a certain kind (e.g., affective), and the tensor is a current “reading” or semantic instantiation at that point.

This would mean:
- Fibers are interpretive dimensions or modes (e.g., Leech’s types of meaning),
- Tensors are semantic activations realized at particular locations (contextual states) in the base space.

#### Option 2: Fibers Themselves Are Fields of Tensors
- Now, the fiber is not a space _containing_ tensors—but rather, a structured flow of tensorial activity over the base.
- In this case, each fiber is like a semantic dynamic system—a field with its own rules, constraints, and trajectories.

This would mean:
- Each fiber is alive, potentially evolving over time or in response to external perturbations.
- Tensors aren’t “sitting” _in_ fibers—they are the fiber’s local expressions.

> "Are fibers modes of meaning (conceptual, connotative, etc.)?"

Then Option 1 might feel more natural:
- The fiber is the interpretive dimension.
- The tensor is the context-specific activation in that dimension.
- Each base point (e.g., current relevance-weighted state) has a bundle of fibers attached, and each fiber contains one or more tensors expressing local meaning.

> "Are fibers as semantic behaviours over time or context?"

Then Option 2 may be truer:
- The fiber is a semantic field—it has its own internal structure and dynamics.
- The tensors are the field’s contents, shifting and interacting as part of a larger system.
- The base space might control _when_ or _how strongly_ the fiber manifests, but the fiber has independent dynamical identity.

> "What Might a Hybrid Look Like?"

Because your system is dynamic and layered, there’s a third way too:
A fiber is a parameterised field—a structure that both contains local tensorial sections _and_ evolves as a whole over time.

That is:
- At any moment, you can take a slice through a fiber and see the tensors at that point (Option 1).
- But the fiber as a whole shifts and flows as a field (Option 2).

This seems compatible with your idea that:
- Fibers re-emerge with history,
- Semantic dynamics are temporal and developmental,
- And meanings are not just selected, but grown.
### Answer
#####  1. The Core Idea You're Adding
 A Prolog-style semantic reasoner, but operating over tensor bundles instead of symbolic predicates.

- It composes lexical bundles (tensor fields),
- Then diagnoses contradictions via geometric inspection (e.g. intersecting incompatible regions),
- And resolves contradictions by:
    - Identifying conflict features,
    - Cleaning them (e.g. dimensionality reduction, pruning),
    - And recomposing.

So instead of:
 “What clause unifies with this goal?”
You’re asking:
 >“What semantic region contradicts this evolving field, and how can that contradiction be smoothed or absorbed?”

This makes contradiction a geometric feature in tensor space—like an intersection with high tension or misalignment.

#####  2. The Role of Geometry in Conflict
This is where your use of computational geometry is profound:
- Contradictions become topological anomalies—regions that can't smoothly co-reside.
- You’re looking for:
    - Discontinuities, incompatibilities, sharp gradients, or non-overlapping constraints.
    - Think: holes, folds, or tears in the semantic manifold.

These become targets for smoothing, dimension reduction, or reinterpretation—again, like a Prolog backtracking, but tensorially enacted.
###  3. Returning to the Tensors-in-Fibers Question
Now, through this lens, your answer becomes clearer:
> Tensors are the local semantic structures (lexical bundles), and the fibers are the geometric and logical spaces they inhabit and traverse during composition and conflict resolution.

So we can say:
- Tensors are sections—but these sections are active and interrogated by the system.
- The fibers themselves are traversable spaces—where contradictions become navigational problems (e.g. “how did we arrive at this contradiction?”).
- And the whole system behaves like a semantic reasoning engine in a curved tensorial space, where conflict is field deformation.

In this sense:
- Fibers are interactive semantic geometries—not just static domains.
- Tensors are the expressed values within those geometries.
- The backtracking/search algorithm works over these fibers, tracing causal and semantic pathways until a contradiction is isolated and collapsed/restructured.

###  Summary
So to consolidate:
- Your system performs constraint satisfaction via tensor composition.
- It uses Prolog-style traversal to find contradiction zones.
- These contradictions are geometric anomalies in semantic space.
- Resolution is dimensionality reduction, tensor pruning, or semantic rebalancing.
- Therefore, fibers are not passive containers, but searchable, interactive structures.
- Tensors are dynamic activations within those fibers—sections, yes, but interpreted, composed, and reasoned over.
