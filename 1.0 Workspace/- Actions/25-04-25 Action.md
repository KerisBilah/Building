## Open Items & Next Steps (quick ledger)

|Block|Outstanding Work|Notes / owners / PV-tags|
|---|---|---|
|**Formal fit**|Prove that $\pi_{\text{surp}}$ preserves functorial integrity of $\mathcal C$.|Short lemma in Appendix B of _Constraint as Rhetoric_.|
|**Parameter tuning**|Empirically or heuristically set $(\vartheta,\tau_S,\mu,\lambda_{\text{surp}})$.|Could be learned from dialogue corpora or hand-set for demos.|
|**TRL-inf insertion**|Explicit algorithmic step: call $\mathcal R_\mu$ after each traversal pass.|Add pseudo-code box in §2.4.|
|**Simulation demo**|Tiny SageMath notebook: two contradiction peaks → watch $\pi_{\text{surp}}$ spawn pseudo-agent, anchoring mass rise, kernel launch.|Nice appendix or Git example repo.|
|**Ethics paragraph**|Relate surprise-driven recognition to AI-safety claim: “opaque until traceable.”|Slot into §1.5.1 of _Agency as Causal Primitive_.|
|**Mirror-neuron link**|One paragraph showing $\pi_{\text{surp}}$ as computational analogue of mirror-system predictive coding.|Could live in cognitive-science background §1.5.2.|
|**Kant & reflective judgement**|Later insertion: recognition as reflective judgement mapping sensations (surprise) to concepts (agent).|Reserve for Kant paper or §0.1 footnote.|


_That should slot cleanly into the existing structure and clarify why surprise, recognition, and the modulation kernel form a single rhetorical-geometric loop. Let me know which task you’d like to push first—or if any definitions need tightening before pasting into the manuscript._

## Sensitivity Mapping for Metric Layer

| If... | Then... |
| ----- | ------- |
| $\alpha$, $\beta$ modified | Agent responsiveness to turbulence adjusts |
| $w_i$ modified | Emphasizes/de-emphasizes different semantic stress factors |
| Collapse threshold $\theta$ raised or lowered | Alters agent’s ultra-stability trigger |
