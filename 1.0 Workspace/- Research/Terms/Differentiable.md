 To be differentiable at $a$, $f$ must:
1. Be defined at $a$ — you can’t take a derivative at a point where the function doesn’t even exist.
2. Be continuous at $a$ — you can’t have jumps, holes, or [[Asymptote]] at $a$.
3. Have a well-defined limit of the difference quotient — the limit must exist and be finite.

Most of the classic functions you use in early calculus are differentiable:
-  Polynomials (like $f(x) = x^2$, $x^3 + 2x - 7$),
-  Exponentials (like $f(x) = e^x$),
-  Trigonometric functions (like $f(x) = \sin(x)$),
-  Rational functions (except where they’re undefined).

Differentiable:
- $f(x) = x^2$→  smooth everywhere → derivative exists everywhere

Not differentiable at a point:
- $f(x) = |x|$ → $\text{ has a sharp corner at } x = 0$

$\Rightarrow$ The left and right limits of the difference quotient don’t match
$\Rightarrow$  No derivative at $0$
