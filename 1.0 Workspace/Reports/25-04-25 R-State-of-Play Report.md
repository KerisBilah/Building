# 0 ▸ Report Overview  

The last four weeks have generated eight converging discussion threads that collectively define the current edge of the project.

| ID | Thread (shorthand)                              | Core Problem                                           | Present Status | Relevance |
|----|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| T1 | *Fuzzy ⇄ Bayesian Functor*                      | Map constraint-resolved fuzzy fields → probabilistic propositions | Concept spec drafted; categorical sketch done | HIGH |
| T2 | *Dynamic Markov Blankets*                       | Show constraint closures give conditional independence | Theory partial; no demo | HIGH |
| T3 | *Stress / Surprise Metric*                      | Tensor metric for semantic strain vs. free-energy      | Formula skeleton; coefficients TBD | MED-HIGH |
| T4 | *Genealogical Explosion*                        | Tractable lineage tracing                              | Heuristics listed; no benchmark | MED |
| T5 | *Blanket Proliferation*                         | Prevent runaway insertion points                       | Attenuation rules drafted | MED |
| T6 | *Ethical Invariant (“Co-operation”)*            | Is synergy assumed?                                    | Clarified as prior, not axiom | LOW |
| T7 | *Implementation Strategy (A vs B)*              | Minimal vs. expressive topology                        | Option B adopted; phased plan | HIGH |
| T8 | *Metaphor Alignment*                            | Harmonise mixed metaphors in one grammar               | 3-layer categorical model stable | MED-HIGH |



# 1 ▸ Thread-by-Thread Synthesis & Gaps  

## T1 — Fuzzy → Bayesian Functor  
*Converged*: identity & composition laws specified.  
*Open*: formal “wellformedness” test; minimal code sample that exports a Pyro net.

## T2 — Dynamic Markov Blankets  
*Converged*: closure ≈ blanket after constraint resolution.  
*Open*: toy simulation showing mutual-information drop; tolerance for graded leaks.

## T3 — Stress / Surprise Metric  
*Converged*: stress tensor ⟨constraint-pressure, curvature, genealogical disruption⟩.  
*Open*: numeric coefficients, calibration routine.

## T4 — Genealogical Explosion  
*Converged*: dormant-by-default + agent continuity compression.  
*Open*: complexity bound; compare sheaf overlay vs. proof tree.

## T5 — Blanket Proliferation  
*Converged*: attenuation half-life & non-event pruning sketched.  
*Open*: formal decay curve, automatic merge criterion.

## T6 — Ethical Invariant  
Resolved: cooperation is a selectable rhetorical prior.

## T7 — Implementation Strategy  
*Converged*: Option B baseline, phased rollout (Kernel → Local Topology → Multi-Agent).  
*Open*: choose tensor engine (Rust + `ndarray` vs. Python + JAX); design mixed-mode scheduler.

## T8 — Metaphor Alignment  
*Converged*: Base-Tensor / Typed-Fiber / Fiber-Type triad.  
*Open*: formal indexed-category definition; commuting diagrams for rhetoric morphisms.



# 2 ▸ Convergence Matrix  

| Aspect                     | Maturity | Risk |
|----------------------------|----------|------|
| Conceptual foundations     | 80 %     | Low  |
| Mathematical formalism     | 60 %     | Medium |
| Algorithmic sketches       | 40 %     | High |
| Prototype code base        | 10 %     | Very High |
| Scalability story          | 30 %     | High |



# 3 ▸ Immediate Action Queue  

- [ ] Micro-demo (T1 + T2) → walk one proposition from fuzzy field → Bayesian net and measure MI across blanket.  
- [ ] Stress tensor v0.1 → implement numeric stress, render surface in SageMath.  
- [ ] Sheaf overlay prototype → benchmark lineage growth vs. Prolog tree.  
- [ ] Repo hygiene → consolidate notebooks into `semantic-agency-lab`.  
- [ ] Tensor-engine decision memo due *2025-05-09*.  
- [ ] Schedule design review post-demo.
