### 1.8 Design Tension Annotations
â¬¡[PV-E6.x]

> Design is negotiation under constraint.  
> Every module, function, or major design choice must record key tension points between flexibility, execution, abstraction, and expansion potential.

Each annotation includes:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Design Tension | The abstract pressure or trade-off (e.g., flexibility vs. speed; abstraction vs. code size) |
| Local Resolution | What design choice was made and why. |
| Expansion Recovery Path | How this choice could be reversed, lifted, or expanded if project needs change. |
| Commentary | Optional remarks to future engineers about consequences, limitations, or subtle side effects. |

Example format inside a module spec:
	Design Tension: Flexibility vs. Execution  
	Local Resolution: Prioritised execution speed; used monomorphic `enum` dispatch rather than polymorphic trait objects.  
	Expansion Recovery Path: Future dynamic dispatch via boxed trait objects (`Box<dyn Trait>`) if runtime flexibility becomes necessary.  
	Commentary: Limits immediate ability to compose multi-mode PTD traversal without code duplication. Acceptable at current stage.

### Rules:
- All major module boundaries must contain at least one Design Tension Annotation.
- No annotation = audit warning at next PV audit checkpoint.
- Commentary is optional but encouraged to build "engineering memory."
