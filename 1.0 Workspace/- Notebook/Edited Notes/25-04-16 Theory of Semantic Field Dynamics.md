## 25-04-16 Theory of Semantic Field Dynamics

> "What is this thing you’re building about, made of, and for?"

This is a pre-formal design sketch, or a pre-axiomatic field manual.
### Define the Ontological Commitments

> "What are the things the theory deals with?"

This theory does not begin with discrete symbols or pre-labelled parts of speech. Instead, it posits a set of ontological primitives that are processual, emergent, and field-based.
1. Semantic Points
   - These are not tokens or words, but emergent positions in a dynamic field.
   - They become “visible” when constraints stabilise into a locally coherent configuration.
   - Analogous to morphogenetic centres in biological development—they don’t exist until tensions resolve into shape.
   
2. The Field
   - A continuously deformable, multidimensional space.
   - It contains latent dimensions (agentivity, modality, affect, etc.) that are only activated under constraint.
   - Think of it as a semantic potential space, like an energy field in physics, but shaped by linguistic, cognitive, and social forces.

3. Propositions
   - Not fixed meanings or truth-bearers.
   - Each proposition is a bundle of interacting constraints—a kind of semantic force vector entering the field.
   
   > NOTE (Position Paper §1.0, §4.0): Consider noting that propositions correspond to objects in the semantic category $\mathcal{F}$, resolved within typed fibers. This reframes constraint bundles as structured semantic objects.

4. Dimensions
   - These are not fixed axes, but potential directions of differentiation.
   - They remain dormant unless activated by constraint interaction.
   - Examples: animacy, intentionality, scalarity, affect, embodiment.

3. Constraints
   - The core operators of the system.
   - Constraints define local conditions for compatibility, coherence, and relevance.
   - They may encode:
	   - Syntactic restrictions
	   - Semantic roles,
	   - Pragmatic expectations,
	   - World knowledge.
> Key Insight: Meaning is not encoded in linguistic units—it emerges as a field event, shaped by the interaction of constraints across a warped semantic space.

### Define the Dynamic Principles
> "How does the space evolve?"

1. Constraint Satisfaction
   - The field seeks a configuration that minimises violation of active constraints.
   - New propositions introduce perturbations—temporary tensions that must be resolved.
   - Satisfaction is non-binary: constraints can be partially satisfied or balanced.
   
   > NOTE (Position Paper §1.0, §4.0): You might link this to morphism-driven transformations within $\mathcal{F}$, where constraint satisfaction corresponds to composition toward local minima in semantic space.

1. Relevance Warping
   - Following Sperber & Wilson, relevance = inferential yield / processing effort.
   - Relevance dynamically warps the geometry of the field:
	   - Relevant dimensions are stretched (more finely resolved),
	   - Irrelevant ones are collapsed.
   - This produces context-sensitive curvature in the semantic landscape.

   > NOTE (Position Paper §4.0): This process could be reframed as an endofunctor acting within a fiber, modulating its internal structure according to cybernetic principles (amplification, attenuation).

3. Inertial Stabilisation
   - Prior discourse and shared knowledge generate field momentum.
   - This makes the field resistant to abrupt shifts unless:
	   - Relevance is very high,
	   - Or contradiction accumulates.
  
3. Interpretive Tension
   - Ambiguity, metaphor, contradiction introduces local energy.
   - The field doesn’t fail—it tenses, and meaning emerges through realignment.
   - Some propositions intentionally raise tension (jokes, irony) and resolve it for effect.

3. Topology of Compatibility
   - Coherence arises not from matching templates, but from aligning constraint surfaces to intersect compatibly.
   - Transformations (metaphor, reframing) are topological operations.

> Key Insight: The field is not passively shaped—it resists, redirects, and reorganises meaning through forces analogous to physical tension, inertia, and curvature.
### Identify the Types of Constraints

> "What are the primitive forces in this space?"

Each constraint is a semantic vector field shaping the local geometry of interpretation.

> NOTE (Position Paper §4.0): Consider formalizing this by defining constraints as morphism-generating structures in $\mathcal{F}$, possibly typed or indexed by fiber modality.

1. Semantic Selection
   - "Drink" prefers liquid nouns.
   - Reflects co-occurrence patterns and conceptual affordances.

2. Pragmatic Expectations
   - Based on context, speaker goals, social norms.
   - E.g., "It's cold in here" may imply a request.

3. Logical Compatibility
   - E.g., "only" + "many" implies contradiction or tension.

4. Domain Activation
   - The field may instantiate specific domains:
	   - Physical space,
	   - Social interaction,
	   - Internal states.
   - These pull forward or suppress dimensions.

5. Metonymic Shifts
   - Allows partial mappings (e.g., institution-for-agent).

1. Prototype Gravity
   - Frequently used meanings act as attractors—low-energy, high-coherence zones.
   - They stabilize nearby interpretations.

> Key Insight: Constraints are local expressions of structured knowledge. They interact globally to produce emergent semantic configurations.

### Explain How Meaning Emerges

> What does it mean for a proposition to "have meaning" in this framework?

1. Meaning ≠ Symbol
   - A proposition has no intrinsic meaning.
   - It modulates the field via constraint propagation.

1. A proposition "means something" when:
	- Constraints interact with the field.
	- The field reconfigures to accommodate them.
	- A stable or metastable configuration is reached where:
		- Contradictions are minimised,
		- Compatibility zones are formed,
		- Salience is optimised.
#### Example: "The argument collapsed under pressure."
- Produces high interpretive tension:
	- "Argument" = abstract
	- "Collapse" = physical structure
- Field attempts topological transformation (metaphor).
- Stabilises via structural metaphor: "arguments as edifices."
- Constraints resolve:
	- Agent = opposing forces
	- Effect = argument failure

> NOTE (Position Paper §3.0): This aligns with the functor $F: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$, where local coherence becomes a belief-compatible configuration. You could reference that formal pathway.

> Key Insight: Meaning is a local minimum in the constraint landscape—a zone of reduced tension where conflicting forces resolve.

### Define the Theoretical Payoff

> What does this framework allow us to see that others can’t?

1. Model Ambiguity and Metaphor Without Breaking
	- These are normal results of overlapping constraint fields.

2. Diagnose Miscommunication
	- A mismatch of constraint systems.
  
3. Handle Context Dynamically
	- Context shifts field shape, allowing fluid adaptation.

4. Track Meaning Over Time
	- Meaning unfolds across a trajectory of propositions.

5. Connect to Embodied, Material Metaphors
	- Field dynamics mirror physical tension, energy, curvature.

> Key Insight: Semantic field dynamics provides a computational semantics of lived experience—flexible, dynamic, sensitive to context, contradiction, and relevance.
