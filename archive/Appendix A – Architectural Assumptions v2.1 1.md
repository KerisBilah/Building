# Sensitivity matrix
sensitivity:
  PV1.3: "Lose functorial 𝓒 → belief projection incoherent"
  PV1.4: "Remove reprojection → no feedback from belief to meaning"
  PV1.5: "Remove φ_pre → no pre-agentive tension; closure emergence becomes arbitrary."
  PV2.2: "Remove threshold → no closure trigger"
  PV3.1: "Drop πᵢ → resolution loses rhetorical modulation"
  PV3.3: "CMS not compositional → constraint stack breaks"
  PV3.4: "Remove ModKernel → agents can’t modulate contradiction, collapse conditions fail dynamically"
  PV4.2: "Agent projection loses referential geometry"
  PV4.3: "d_KAI undefined → no agent-divergence metric"
  PV4.4: "Agent similarity index ℰ(𝒜ᵢ,𝒜ⱼ) computed via (γ, τ, φ) field alignment."
  PV-AI0: "Drop ethical framing → misdiagnosis of agency emergence; safety audits lose coherence"

## Canonical PV Tag Definitions

```yaml
# version: 2.0
# last_updated: 2025-04-23
# status: stable
# document: Foundational Priors v2.0
#———————————————#
pv:
  PV0.1: "Motivating intuitions do not require validation; they define semantic task-space."
  
  # Formal Objects
  PV1.1: "Relevance field R : ℱ → ℝⁿ defines agent salience and concern."
  PV1.2: "Contradiction field Ξ is the deformation gradient over ℱ."
  PV1.3: "Projection functor ℂ : ℱ → ℬ preserves topological warp structure during closure."
  PV1.4: "Reprojection functor ℂ⁻¹ : ℬ → ℱ enables belief-driven field reshaping."
  PV1.5: "Pre-agentive teleological field φ_pre : ℱ → Tℱ arises from intrinsic contradiction and entropy gradients, before agent closure."

  # Closure and Constraint
  PV2.1: "Cone of concern: bounded region defined by φ, R, and κ."
  PV2.2: "Closure occurs only when κ + ℰ + Ξ > θ."
  PV2.3: "Each closure logs τ (narrative trace) and η (irreducible core)."
  
  # Rhetorical Structures
  PV3.1: "Rhetorical morphisms πᵢ modulate ℂ under contradiction."
  PV3.2: "All rhetorical priors πᵢ preserve narrative continuity via τ."
  PV3.3: "Constraint Morphism Stack (CMS) is modular, compositional, and topologically aware."
  PV3.4: "Modulation Kernel enables agents to locally reshape contradiction and sustain partial legibility."

  # Interpretive Geometry
  PV4.1: "KAI index computes semantic compression failure."
  PV4.2: "Triadic projection schema ℙ = (𝒮, 𝔸̄, Â) defines agentive interpretation structure in ℬ."
  PV4.3: "d_KAI = divergence metric computing structural dissimilarity between irreducible agent projections in ℬ via KAI traces (τ, η)."
  PV4.4: "Agent similarity index ℰ(𝒜ᵢ,𝒜ⱼ) computed via alignment of γ (warp), τ (trace), and φ (teleology)."
  PV-AI0: "Ethical safety orientation: agency must be implicatable and traceable under contradiction-driven closure. Safety is achieved through semantic responsibility, not control."
