# UCSE Engine Specification Plan

## 1. Purpose

The UCSE Engine implements the Unified Constraint Satisfaction Cycle, enabling dynamic semantic resolution in alignment with the theoretical structure defined in Foundational Priors v2.2 and UCSE v2.1.

Its primary goal is faithful realisation of field-based constraint processing, closure formation, and agentive projection.


## 2. Core Modules

| Module | Function | Key Interfaces |
|:-------|:---------|:---------------|
| Tensor Field Manager | Manages and updates semantic tensor fields ($\mathcal{F}$) | Internal tensors, PTD hooks |
| Constraint Activation Layer | Activates and applies constraints based on field tension | Constraint morphisms, rhetorical priors (πₙ) |
| Partial Tucker Decomposition Engine | Performs local PTD on selected mode subsets $S$ | Tensor Field Manager, Closure Detection |
| Semantic Tension Monitor | Computes $\mathcal{T}_{\text{local}}$ from curvature, entropy, PTD residuals | Tensor Field Manager |
| Closure Detector & Scaffold Manager | Detects closure conditions; manages $\Omega_s$ scaffolds and promotions | Tension Monitor, Projection Layer |
| Projection & Reprojection Layer | Manages $\mathcal{C}: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$ pathways | Belief field ($\mathcal{B}$) |
| Agent Trace Constructor | Builds and tracks agent warps $(\gamma, \tau, \phi)$ | Scaffold Manager, Projection Layer |

## 3. Data Structures

| Structure | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| Semantic Tensor ($T$) | Primary field representation; multi-mode semantic space |
| Constraint Bundle | Localised set of active constraints |
| PTD Core ($G$) | Core tensor from local decomposition |
| Semantic Scaffold ($\Omega_s$) | Partial closure object awaiting promotion |
| Belief Trace ($\tau$) | Closure trace recording emergent agent histories |
| Agent Warp ($\gamma$) | Persistent field deformation associated with agent identity |
| Teleological Field ($\phi$) | Pre-agentive and agentive vector fields guiding semantic flow |

## 4. Execution Cycle

1. Compose local semantic bundles in $\mathcal{F}$.
2. Activate constraints via rhetorical priors $\pi_i$ and context.
3. Decompose via Partial Tucker on selected mode subsets.
4. Monitor semantic tension $\mathcal{T}_{\text{local}}$ across field.
5. Detect closure vs. scaffold regions.
6. Promote or Stabilise scaffolds based on $\epsilon_{\text{promotion}}$.
7. Project stable closures into $\mathcal{B}$, preserving field topology.
8. Update agent traces and constraint memory.
9. Recompose semantic bundles for next cycle.


## 5. Design Priorities

- Field-First: Preserve $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ as topological fields; discretization only at localized, recoverable points.
- Modularity: All core modules are pluggable and swappable.
- Performance: Optimize PTD and tension monitoring for high-dimensional fields.
- Traceability: Ensure all closures and constraint resolutions are logged via $\tau$ traces.
- Ethical Integrity: All agentive emergences must be structurally implicatable.

## 6. Open Implementation Questions

- Dynamic mode subset selection policies for PTD.
- Adaptive weighting of semantic tension components ($w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$).
- Constraint fatigue modeling (rhetorical decay kernels).
- Error handling when scaffold promotion fails.
- Functorial tracking of semantic-to-belief transitions.

## 7. Planned Technologies

| Component | Language / Stack |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| Core Engine | Rust |
| Tensor Operations | Rust ndarray / custom |
| Modular Compositions | Rust trait and module system |
| Future Visualization | Jupyter + Rust kernel (e.g., evcxr_jupyter) |
| Testing Framework | Rust cargo test + simulation drivers |

# Summary

The UCSE Engine is a modular, field-aware, constraint-satisfaction system for dynamic semantic architectures.

Its goal is not just engineering implementation — it is faithful operationalization of a new model of meaning:  
> Constraint as Rhetoric. Closure as Emergence. Agents as Fields.
