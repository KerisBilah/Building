## 25-04-16 Across Fuzzy and Stochastic Spaces

> ⚠️ NOTE (April 2025 Update): This document reflects an earlier formulation using fibered category-theoretic structures (base + fiber).  
> The current theoretical direction is transitioning toward a material-tensor model of semantic dynamics and argumentative structure.  
> While the functorial mappings and constraint logic still apply, the fibered formalism will be replaced by interacting tensor spaces guided by material strain, rhetorical curvature, and category-compliant deformation theory.  
> A position paper is in progress formalising this transition.

## Step 1: Existing Proposition in the Stochastic (Belief) Space

Imagine you have a well-labeled suitcase in a storage room—everything inside is neatly packed and labeled with how important it is, when it was last used, and any special handling instructions. That’s what a proposition looks like when it’s stored in the Belief Space. It’s all about keeping track of the proposition’s probabilistic weight (how likely or relevant it is), its travel history, and any important cues for how it might interact with future ideas. 

In the Belief Space, each proposition is a lower-dimensional representation that captures its core inference details, such as:
- Confidence or weighting (akin to a probability measure).
- Relevance history (timestamps or usage metadata).
- Agentive vectors describing roles like actor, patient, and effect.  

A proposition here is treated as a node within a broader Markovian framework, meaning it’s influenced by (and influences) other nodes within certain boundaries (Markov blankets). This setup helps the system estimate how reintroducing or modifying the proposition might shift overall beliefs, predictions, or causal inferences. 

- Representation: Let $p \in \mathcal{P}$ be a proposition in the Belief Space $\mathcal{B}$. We often model $p$ as a distribution $\mu_p$ over possible outcomes or contexts.
- Agentive Metadata: Define an agentive vector $a_p = (\text{actor}, \text{patient}, \text{effect})$ associated with each proposition $p$.
- Markov Blanket: Each proposition $p$ is within a subgraph $\mathcal{M}_p \subset \mathcal{B}$ representing the set of directly connected beliefs. Formally:

$$
\mathcal{M}_p = \text{min} \left\{ S \subset \mathcal{B} \,:\, S \text{ d-separates } p \text{ from } \mathcal{B} \setminus S \right\}
$$

> NOTE (Position Paper §3.0, §4.0): This representation aligns with treating $\mathcal{B}$ as a probabilistic manifold whose curvature reflects concern-based structure. The Markov blanket functions as a local semantic boundary.

## Step 2: New Semantic Encounter & Re-Lifting to the Fuzzy Space
When a new semantic field arises (e.g., a novel topic or shift in discourse), the system lifts a previously collapsed belief proposition into a high-dimensional semantic tensor space. This allows the previously "boxed" belief to flex and interact with new meaning material.

Mechanism:
1. Functorial Lifting: Converts low-dimensional belief $p$ into a semantic tensor $\phi_p$.
2. Boundary Selection: Only contextually relevant elements of $p$ are lifted (via Markov filters).
3. Stylistic Modulation: Idiolect or rhetorical constraints reshape how $p$ is expressed in tensor form.
- Lifting Functor: Let $F : \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ be the mapping from belief to semantic space. Then:

$$
F(p) = \phi_p = (\text{semantic\_tensor}(p),\, \text{context\_constraints})
$$
- Contextual Filter: Define $\beta(p)$ as a boolean selector on agentive and rhetorical metadata. Then:
$$
F(p) = \phi_p \big|_{\beta(p)}
$$
> NOTE (Position Paper §1.0, §2.0): This lifting operation is compatible with a tensor-based view, replacing fiber instantiation with dimensional re-expression within a semantic manifold.

## Step 3: Resolution via Fuzzy Constraint Satisfaction

Now the lifted tensor $\phi_p$ and the incoming semantic field $\phi_{\text{new}}$ interact. Constraint satisfaction operates as a local deformation process: stretching, aligning, or contracting semantic regions until a stable configuration emerges.
### Steps:
1. Local Compatibility: Pairwise constraints are evaluated between tensor components.
2. Perturbation Operators: Explore neighboring configurations to test for higher coherence.
3. Amplification/Attenuation: Cybernetic modulation adjusts prominence or suppression of meaning clusters.

- Satisfaction Function:
$$
\max_{S \subseteq \Phi} \sum_{\phi_i, \phi_j \in S} w_{ij} \cdot \mathrm{Comp}(\phi_i, \phi_j)
$$

- Perturbation Operator:
$$
\mathrm{Perturb}(\phi_i, \epsilon)
$$

- Synthesis Output:
$$
\phi_{\mathrm{merge}} = \arg\max_S \left(\mathrm{global\_coherence}(S)\right)
$$

> NOTE (Position Paper §4.0): Constraint satisfaction is now best modeled as a tensor contraction process rather than compositional fiber merger. Compatible with a material dynamics view of semantic evolution.
## Step 4: Re-Embedding in the Stochastic (Belief) Space

Once the merged tensor $\phi_{\mathrm{merge}}$ achieves stability, it is collapsed back into a belief-state proposition, complete with probability, relevance metadata, and rhetorical structure.
### Steps:
1. Functorial Collapse: $G : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ maps tensors to belief nodes.
2. Topology Update: The belief space is updated to accommodate the new node.
3. Agentive Re-projection: Semantic vectors (actor, patient, effect) are preserved.

- Collapse Functor:
$$
G(\phi_{\mathrm{merge}}) = p_{\mathrm{new}} \in \mathcal{B}
$$

- Belief Space Transformation:
$$
T : \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \cup \{p_{\mathrm{new}}\}
$$

- Agentive Vector Mapping:
$$
G(a_{\phi_{\mathrm{merge}}}) = a_{p_{\mathrm{new}}}
$$

> NOTE (Position Paper §3.0, §6.0): This process reflects a tensor-to-scalar projection that preserves semantic curvature as belief topology. The belief space inherits rhetorical tension and argumentative trace from the source configuration.
