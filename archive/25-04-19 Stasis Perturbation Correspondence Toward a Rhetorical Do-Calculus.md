## 25-04-19 Stasis-Perturbation Correspondence-Toward a Rhetorical Do-Calculus

This note explores the surprising resonance between classical rhetorical stasis theory and Pearl’s do-calculus, when understood through the lens of a constraint- and tensor-based semantic engine. The aim is to sketch an outline of how deliberative structure might be mapped onto formal causal reasoning, especially within an interpreter architecture grounded in tensor fields and constraint satisfaction.

### 1. Stasis as Structured Perturbation

Stasis theory offers a layered framework for diagnostic reasoning and intervention:

- Conjecture – *Did it happen?*  
  A question of *existence* within the semantic field: is the tensor even coherent with the current configuration?

- Definition – *What is it?*  
  A question of *type and mode*: what kind of semantic or causal role does this tensor play?

- Quality – *How important is it?*  
  A question of *concern and value gradients*: how does this tensor modulate relevance, utility, or affect?

- Policy – *What should be done?*  
  A question of *intervention*: which tensor must be fixed, perturbed, or surgically altered to resolve semantic contradiction?

Each stasis point can be implemented as a diagnostic pass in a Prolog-style inference engine, operating over a tensorial semantic substrate. Contradictions between tensors are treated as sites of deliberative friction—potential loci for intervention.

### 2. Do-Calculus as Tensorial Intervention Syntax

The do-operator is reinterpreted here as a semantic surgery: a formal removal of upstream constraints on a tensor in order to isolate and test its downstream effects. Within the architecture, this amounts to:

- Removing incoming tensor constraints (disconnecting the variable from its causes),
- Fixing the tensor to a specific value (setting a boundary condition),
- Allowing propagation through constraint satisfaction (observing the resulting semantic cascade).

This aligns well with the architecture’s use of constraint satisfaction as operational tensor arithmetic: do-calculus becomes a *grammar of allowed constraint edits*, governed by the logic of d-separation and causal invariance.

The three rules of do-calculus can be reimagined as meta-constraints or permissible tensor transformations:

- Rule 1: Drop observations when d-separation renders them irrelevant — a kind of *projection* or mode-reduction.
- Rule 2: Replace interventions with observations when indistinguishable in effect — a *constraint type exchange*.
- Rule 3: Drop interventions when redundant — a *stasis-resolved policy retraction*.

Each rule is a way of navigating semantic contradiction and refining deliberative scope.

### 3. Convergence and Interpretation

The key insight is that rhetorical stasis theory provides a structured scaffold for interpreting where and how tensor contradictions arise. It acts as a *heuristic overlay* to causal reasoning: not just mapping what can be inferred or intervened upon, but how the interpreter arrives at that decision, and what kind of interpretive work each intervention represents.

Conversely, do-calculus enriches stasis theory by formalising the conditions under which rhetorical commitments become causally active—when a deliberative diagnosis must give way to an operative cut.

Together, they sketch the outline of a semantic deliberation engine—one capable of navigating meaning not merely as inference, but as structured action within a semantic ecology.
