Would you say that surprise, in your system, is more topological—about proximity to active zones—or more probabilistic—about entropy in the stochastic modeling layer? Or maybe both, depending on how the lifting happens?

Co-reference and actor persistence are sitting right at the fault line between the fuzzy and the stochastic layers. These are the kinds of semantic threads that have to _survive_ transformations: through shifts in context, resolution, or generative composition. They're like invariants—or maybe _quasi-invariants_—that need to be tracked across changes in representational format.

In Gärdenfors’ framework, you might think of an actor as a vector bundle of features or properties that persists across different scenes or propositions. But in your model, that persistence only holds if the translations—between fuzzy and stochastic layers—can maintain a sense of identity, even if the representation changes. So this “talking between the systems” isn’t just data passing between modules. It’s a kind of interpretive negotiation.

I wonder—could this be modelled as a _natural transformation_ between functors? 

That would let you describe not just the mappings from fuzzy to stochastic and back, but how those mappings themselves vary across contexts while still preserving structural correspondences. It could be what lets co-reference remain stable even as propositions shift.

Do you imagine co-reference being handled as a fixed identity relation, or something more graded—like a similarity-based persistence, influenced by relevance and prediction across propositions?
