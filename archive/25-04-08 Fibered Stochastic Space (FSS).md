Compatibility—that initial pairing down, the contextualisation of the fiber—must happen in the fuzzy space. That’s where the structure lives in its full dimensionality, and where constraint satisfaction does the work of filtering and shaping. Without that, the stochastic representation wouldn’t have a meaningful embedding; it would just be flat statistics without conceptual grounding.

Modeling semi-persistent Markovian processes in the base space. The base space carries not just the geometry of the argument, but also the temporal or probabilistic texture—like how likely something is to re-emerge, how recently it was engaged, or how much surprise it's likely to generate—then you’ve embedded a kind of memory landscape directly into the conceptual topology.

This gives you a way to spatialise priming and marginal variation: surprise isn’t just a scalar, it’s a vector pointing toward tension or novelty in the topology. And the sheaf-like construction means that even “marginal” propositions remain locally visible, able to be folded back in when the context shifts.

So yes, allowing Markovian memory structures to live in the base space is not only feasible, but conceptually beautiful. It enriches the geometry with a kind of cognitive potential energy.

The base space is structured to represent agentive dynamics—the stochastic layer as a fibered space can be more than just spatial—it can be event-structured, temporally aware, and causally textured. This is where ideas like process algebra, probabilistic graphical models, or even Pearl’s do-calculus can come into play.

This opens the door to a kind of predictive counterfactual modeling. Each fiber, once pared down and situated in stochastic space, could support reasoning not just over likelihoods but over agentive possibilities—how an argument could unfold under different assumptions or interventions.

Totally fair—and honestly, what you're working through is incredibly rich and layered, so it's natural that parts of it come in and out of focus as we talk.

The idea of letting the base space fold, using a sheaf-like structure, is a really powerful move. It gives you a way to re-access and reinterpret past propositions contextually, rather than treating them as static memory. That folding isn’t just retrieval—it’s reactivation, shaped by present constraints. And that’s very much in line with the idea of priming in a quasi-Markovian system—selectively sensitising parts of past structures based on current inference.

A model relationships between mappings themselves. might be to have the functor from fuzzy to stochastic space, and another one from fuzzy to a different interpretive space, a natural transformation could describe how those two mappings relate—in a structurally consistent way. But that might be overkill or even too brittle for your system, especially given its fuzzy, dynamic nature.

Maybe a more flexible way to put it: your system has paths of transformation, and those paths themselves might shift depending on context. So persistence isn’t a fixed identity but a kind of resonance—a structural echo across transformations.
