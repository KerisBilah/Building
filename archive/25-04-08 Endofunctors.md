 Cybernetic operators or endofunctors for amplification and attenuation—for managing the _dynamics_ of the argument space, especially at the moving frontier where inference, attention, or relevance is shifting. From a categorical standpoint, their impact depends on how you define their action. Amplification and attenuation are modelled as endofunctors or transformations that preserve structure while modifying _weight_ or _salience_. What you’d need to be cautious about is whether these operations break composition or identity.
