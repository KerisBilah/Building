# Big Picture Overview
## 1. Fuzzy Lexical Substrate (Idiolect)
Each person (or modelled agent) carries a personal set of conceptual structures—a lexicon—that isn't composed of fixed dictionary entries but of flexible, overlapping meanings. Think of this as a conceptual cloud or semantic terrain.
- Concepts have graded features: a word like "freedom" doesn't have one fixed meaning, but a range of possibilities.
- These meanings vary by speaker, time, and context.
- This resembles the linguistic concept of an idiolect—an individual's unique way of structuring and using language.
## 2. Fusion Events & Markov Chain Nodes
As thought or discourse unfolds, concepts from this fuzzy lexicon are used in context. This usage creates temporary fusion events:
- Ambiguity resolves as meanings crystallise into context-specific interpretations.
- Each resolved meaning becomes a node in a Markov chain, tracking transitions between interpretations.
- These transitions support inference, dialogue, and action.
## 3. Agentive Force & Event Geometry
Drawing from Gärdenfors’ conceptual spaces:
- Events are modelled as movements in meaning-space, caused by agents.
- Agents exert semantic force, shifting discourse through speech or action.
- Discourse has vector dynamics—directionality and intensity shaped by agent intention.
## 4. Multi-Fiber Traversal
Every meaningful act is multi-layered, operating on different interpretive channels:
- Semantic (literal meaning)
- Emotional (affect and tone)
- Stylistic (genre, irony, etc.)
- Social (group identity, roles)
Concepts traverse these layers simultaneously—modelled as fibers in a bundle.
## 5. Sheaf-Like Memory Structures
Resolved concepts aren’t discarded:
- Each fusion event is stored in a memory sheaf.
- These preserve fuzziness while incorporating context.
- This structure supports context-sensitive retrieval and evolution of past meanings.
# Toy Example: Political Speech
> Scenario: A speaker says: _"We need to restore freedom in our society."_
1. Fuzzy Lexicon: "Freedom" evokes autonomy, rights, liberty, etc.
2. Fusion: In context (e.g. post-pandemic debate), "freedom" fuses with opposition to mandates.
3. Markov Transition: The next speaker replies to _that_ version of "freedom".
4. Agentive Force: The first speaker redirects discourse.
5. Multi-Fiber Traversal: The term resonates emotionally (fear), stylistically (populism), and socially (identity signalling).
6. Sheaf-Like Storage: This use of "freedom" becomes part of collective and agentive memory, influencing future discourse.
# Formalism (for Cognitive Science / Math / Stats)
Let:
- $\mathcal{F}$ = fuzzy manifold (idiolect)
- $\mathcal{B}$ = base space of Bayesian belief states
- $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ = projection from fuzzy concepts to resolved propositions
- $\pi^{-1}(b)$ = fiber over $b$, i.e., compatible fuzzy meanings
- $\phi: \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{B}'$ = fusion map (contextual resolution)
A fusion event is:  
$$
b_t \xrightarrow{\phi(f, b_t)} b_{t+1}
$$
Memory as sheaf:  
$\mathcal{S}(b) = \{ f \in \mathcal{F} : f \text{ contributed to or was evaluated at } b \}$
Agentive force:  $A_t \subset T\mathcal{F}$  — a vector field tracing conceptual movement through discourse. 
System dynamics:
- Operates as a Markov process over $\mathcal{B}$
- Guided by: Predictions: $P(b_{t+1} \mid b_t)$ Influence from candidate fields: $F_{b_t}$
- Transitions minimise predictive error (free energy) while maintaining links to $\mathcal{F}$
Supports:
- Incremental meaning resolution
- Multi-layered interpretation (fiber traversal)
- Context-sensitive memory (sheaf structure)
- Agent-driven discourse modeling
