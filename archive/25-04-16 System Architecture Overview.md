## 25-04-16 System Architecture Overview

### 1. Fuzzy Semantic Base ($\mathcal{F}$)

The fuzzy semantic base is defined as a category $\mathcal{F}$:
- Objects: Resolved semantic configurations, understood as stabilised bundles of constraint-satisfied meanings. These are field-based rather than symbolic entities.
- Morphisms: Operations over these configurations—e.g. fusion, transformation, metaphor, or rhetorical reframing. Each morphism must preserve constraint satisfaction and operate within typed fibers.
- Endofunctors: Represent cybernetic modulation—amplification, attenuation, salience skewing—that act within a fiber without changing its type. These preserve identity and composition.
- Fibered Structure: Each semantic configuration lives within a typed fiber. Fiber types distinguish between interpretive regimes (e.g. causal, analogical, evidential, rhetorical, affective).

The space is "fuzzy" in that meanings are not discrete symbols but dynamic, continuous fields resolved through constraint satisfaction. Propositions are local minima in this configuration space.
### 2. Stochastic Inference Manifold ($\mathcal{B}$)
The stochastic belief space is represented as a separate category $\mathcal{B}$:
- Objects: Belief-state configurations, represented as probabilistic manifolds or inference-ready structures.
- Morphisms: Transitions such as Bayesian updates, belief revision, or the reshaping of inferential topologies.
- Base Space: Defined in terms of concern or teleological proximity—modeling distance from goal states, coherence thresholds, or epistemic resolution.

Inference within $\mathcal{B}$ is shaped not only by probabilistic logic but also by the curvature of the concern manifold. Prior beliefs bias the topology and constrain future transitions.
### 3. The Functor $F: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$
A key translation mechanism is the functor $F$ that maps from the fuzzy semantic category to the stochastic belief category:
- Structure-Preserving: It maps objects (semantic configurations) in $\mathcal{F}$ to belief objects in $\mathcal{B}$, preserving compositional structure.
- Morphisms: A sequence of constraint resolutions in $\mathcal{F}$ becomes an inference chain in $\mathcal{B}$.
- Identity Preservation: Unchanged propositions (semantic stasis) yield identity morphisms in $\mathcal{B}$.

This functor formalizes the process by which meaning is interpreted into belief, resolving field tension into actionable or stable belief structures.
### 4. Typed Fibers and Modal Traversal
Fibers in $\mathcal{F}$ are typed—they define what kind of semantic composition is valid:
- Causal: Structured by event-based logic.
- Analogical: Governed by mapping and metaphor.
- Rhetorical: Shaped by stylistic, dialogic, or affective force.

Traversal across fibers—e.g. from metaphor to inference—must be governed by either:
- Shared constraints, or
- Higher-order mappings that lift configurations across types.

Cross-fiber compatibility is not assumed: typing restricts invalid compositions while enabling structured inter-type dynamics.
### 5. Memory and Argumentative Mass
Memory is not a discrete module, but a dynamic sheaf over the base tensor:
- Resolved configurations are stored as local trace fields.
- Argumentative saturation increases curvature in the base, encoding memory as a deformation in semantic geometry.
- Relevance, salience, and priming gradients emerge from accumulated semantic tension.

Thus, memory arises from field dynamics—stored in the topology, not in a symbolic store.
### 6. Toy Example (Freedom Discourse)

> Speaker says: "We must restore freedom in our society."

- Fiber: "Freedom" occupies a rhetorical fiber, shaped by contextual constraint.
- Constraint Resolution: In this context (e.g., post-crisis), "freedom" fuses with a cluster of meanings (anti-mandate, autonomy).
- Functorial Collapse: This configuration is mapped via $F$ into a probabilistic belief state representing the speaker's stance.
- Base Tensor Deformation: This instantiation of "freedom" increases argumentative density in the region—making future mentions easier to resolve.
- Memory Sheaf Update: This instance becomes part of the semantic trace structure that influences ongoing discourse.

This formalised architecture reframes earlier metaphorical sketches into a coherent categorical structure. It retains conceptual richness while enabling compositional rigor and clear system-wide reasoning.

## Update Notes on System Architecture Overview
### 1. Fuzzy Semantic Base ($\mathcal{F}$)
- A category whose objects are resolved semantic configurations (constraint-resolved fields)
- Morphisms correspond to operations like fusion, transformation, metaphor, etc.
- Endofunctors encode cybernetic modulation (amplification, attenuation)
- Each configuration resides in a typed fiber over a point in a base relevance tensor
### 2. Stochastic Inference Manifold ($\mathcal{B}$)
- A belief state space with concern-based curvature
- Objects: belief-state configurations
- Morphisms: transitions via Bayesian update or rhetorical shift
- Memory as curvature or vector trace
### 3. The Functor $F: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$
- Translates field-resolved propositions into structured belief updates
- Preserves compositional structure (morphisms)
- Enforces fiber compatibility rules during resolution
### 4. Typed Fibers and Modal Traversal
- Each fiber is a compositional space for a particular semantic regime (e.g., causal, analogical, metaphorical)
- Traversal across fibers corresponds to multi-modal interpretation
- Compatibility constraints regulate interaction
### 5. Memory and Argumentative Mass
- Resolved configurations are stored in a memory sheaf
- Argumentative reinforcement increases curvature in base tensor
- Memory affects salience, expectation, and attention gradients
