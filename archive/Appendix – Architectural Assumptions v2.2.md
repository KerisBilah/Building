#
# Sensitivity matrix
sensitivity:
  PV1.3: "Lose functorial 𝓒 → belief projection incoherent"
  PV1.4: "Remove reprojection → no feedback from belief to meaning"
  PV1.5: "Remove φ_pre → no pre-agentive tension; closure emergence becomes arbitrary"
  PV2.2: "Remove threshold → no closure trigger"
  PV3.1: "Drop πᵢ → resolution loses rhetorical modulation"
  PV3.3: "CMS not compositional → constraint stack breaks"
  PV3.4: "Remove ModKernel → agents can’t modulate contradiction, collapse conditions fail dynamically"
  PV4.2: "Agent projection loses referential geometry"
  PV4.3: "d_KAI undefined → no agent-divergence metric"
  PV4.4: "Agent similarity index ℰ(𝒜ᵢ,𝒜ⱼ) computed via (γ, τ, φ) field alignment"
  PV5.1: "Dynamic field tension metrics undefined → no adaptive stability under perturbation"
  PV5.2: "Variety mismatch undefined → no diagnosis of expressive divergence"
  PV5.3: "Compressibility-Stress Metric undefined"
  PV5.4: "Critical Threshold Metric (CTM) undefined"
  PV-AI0: "Drop ethical framing → misdiagnosis of agency emergence; safety audits lose coherence"

pv:
  PV0.1: "Motivating intuitions do not require validation; they define semantic task-space."

  # Formal Objects
  PV1.1: "Relevance field R : 𝓕 → ℝⁿ defines agent salience and concern."

  PV1.3: "Projection functor 𝓒 : 𝓕 → 𝓑 preserves topological warp structure during closure."
  PV1.3.1: "If belief space is treated as a discrete graph instead of a stochastic field, projection continuity and agentive closure topology are broken."
  PV1.4: "Reprojection functor 𝓒⁻¹ : 𝓑 → 𝓕 enables belief-driven field reshaping."
