## 25-04-08 Questions Stochastic structures under constraint resolution

The behaviour of stochastic structures under constraint resolution, and how fuzziness gets converted into inference potential.
Here are three to start:
1. What aspects of the standard Markov formalism are you preserving—and what are you breaking or reinterpreting?  
    For example: Are your “Markov blankets” still functioning as _conditional independence boundaries_? Or are they more like temporary closures in a field—dialectically significant but probabilistically loose?
    
2. How are you envisioning the chain dynamics?  
    Standard Markov chains assume fixed transition probabilities between discrete states. But in your model, is the “next state” selected more like a contextual fusion? And if so, is this still Markovian in any meaningful sense, or is it a kind of stochastic yet semantically biased movement across a fuzzy field?
    
3. What would it mean to make this bridge between fuzzy logic and stochastic process formal?
    Are you imagining a shared underlying geometry (e.g., a manifold where fuzzy constraint surfaces and probabilistic gradients live together)? Or are you looking for a precise translation rule—a mapping from stable fuzzy configurations into prior/likelihood structures?
