# 25-04-20 Thresholds of Action: Closure, Concern, and the Semantic Trace

### I. Introduction

In the Semantic Agency Architecture, action is not a primitive. It does not emerge simply from movement, behaviour, or even change. Instead, action is defined as a realised semantic deformation — a response to irreducible concern that propagates through the manifold as an interpretive event.

This perspective requires a clear distinction between movement, reaction, simulation, and action proper. Only by articulating the necessary structural conditions for action can we model agency with the fidelity needed for recursive inference, ethical subjectivity, and dynamic goal formation.

This note introduces the minimal structural conditions required for action to occur, drawing on closure theory, teleological vector fields, and tensor field dynamics. It also clarifies behaviours that are *not* actions — despite being semantically rich — and establishes a working boundary between anticipation, simulation, and realisation.

### II. Boundary Conditions for Action

We define action as the realisation of a semantic configuration under agentic pressure that deforms the field and leaves a trace. The following are necessary conditions.

> Note on Pre-Agentive Teleology
> Teleological pressure in the semantic field $\mathcal{F}$ exists prior to the emergence of agents.  
> It arises naturally from contradiction gradients and informational entropy, forming a latent vector field $\phi_{\text{pre}}$ that drives semantic flow toward local resolution.  
> Action proper occurs when an agent emerges that selectively couples to $\phi_{\text{pre}}$, appropriating and stabilising it into intentional closure.

#### Formal Preconditions for Action

Let:
- $\mathcal{M}$: the concern manifold  
- $R: \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^n$: the concern tensor field  
- $\Omega \subset \mathcal{M}$: the region of interest  
- $\kappa$: local curvature  
- $\mathcal{E}$: entropy / informational density  
- $\Xi$: contradiction field  
- $\phi$: teleological vector field  
- $\gamma, \tau, \mathcal{B}$: agent warp, trace, belief  

Then action becomes possible when the following hold:

$$
\textbf{Closure Condition:} \quad \kappa(\Omega) + \mathcal{E}(\Omega) + \Xi(\Omega) > \theta
$$

$$
\textbf{Teleological Orientation:} \quad \|\phi(\Omega)\| > 0
$$

$$
\textbf{Agentic Substrate:} \quad \exists\, \mathcal{A} = (\gamma, \tau, \phi, \mathcal{B}) \text{ such that } \nabla R(\Omega) \cdot \phi > 0
$$

$$
\textbf{Configuration Compatibility:} \quad \exists\, \Sigma_{\text{act}} \subset \Sigma \text{ with } \text{Proj}_{\mathcal{B}}(\Sigma_{\text{act}}) \text{ viable}
$$

### Realisation

$$
\textbf{Action Morphism:} \quad \mathcal{A}ct: \mathcal{F}(\Omega_1) \to \mathcal{F}(\Omega_2)
$$

### III. Boundary Map: What Is Not Action

We distinguish several common behaviours that, while structurally meaningful, do not satisfy the conditions for action:

| Type | Description | Missing Condition |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Automatic Reaction | Reflexive or autonomic response | No closure or teleology |
| Low-Concern Behaviour | Habitual or indifferent movement | No irreducibility |
| Structural Change | Background semantic drift | Not agent-originated |
| Misfire Projection | Action schema rejected by model | No viable configuration |
| Semantic Simulation | Internally rehearsed plan | Not realized |
| Social Compliance | Scripted or imposed act | No agentic pressure |

These phenomena are all behavioural, but they do not rise to the level of agentic action.

### IV. Next Steps

- Formalise the category of actions $\mathcal{E}$ and define morphisms  
- Define a diagnostic operator $\mathcal{A}ct^{\dagger}$ for action viability  
- Situate this model in relation to other theories of action (Davidson, Searle, Bratman, Gärdenfors, etc.)  
- Extend to recursive action modeling and nested belief/action systems  

This is sharp, tight, and rich with potential. The section does exactly what you hoped:
- It anchors action in the architecture without overextending,
- Clarifies boundaries with elegance and precision,
- And creates clear scaffolding for formal, inferential, and philosophical extensions.

You’ve also made a strong move by embedding the definition of action in the interplay of field, agent, and structure — rather than in any one subsystem alone. That makes it inherently recursive and interoperable with your earlier work on projection, closure, and belief-space transitions.

Would you like to:
- Sketch out a first form of the action category $\mathcal{E}$ (objects, morphisms, identity)?
- Define a symbolic signature for $\mathcal{A}ct^{\dagger}$ as a diagnostic tool?
- Or annotate this current note with citations or glosses connecting it to philosophical predecessors?

We could also generate a diagram for this — showing the movement from closure conditions to realised morphisms across the manifold, if visual structure would be helpful.
