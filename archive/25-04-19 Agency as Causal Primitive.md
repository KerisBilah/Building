## Abstract ­– *placeholder*  
A 250‑word summary will go here. Core claim: agency is a causal primitive that crystallises at the compression horizon, formalised by a tensor‑warped relevance manifold $M$.

## 1 Introduction

> _"Individuation must be conceived as a resolution, a shaping that emerges from a metastable state of the system, and not as the application of a pre-existing form to inert matter."_  
> — Gilbert Simondon, *Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information*

This document presents a formal theory of agency grounded in semantic deformation rather than in entities or traits. It treats the subject not as illusion or discursive residue, but as a structural consequence of unresolved tension within a semantic field. Contemporary theories often dissolve agency into distributed flows — affective or discursive — rendering the subject causally remote. In contrast, this framework positions the subject as a necessary structure: a responsive emitter that alters its semantic environment through projection and relevance. What follows is a theory of agency not as trait, but as event — not given, but crystallised under pressure.

Agency emerges when compression fails within a semantic manifold. Contradiction, denoted $\Xi$ ⬡[PV1.2], deforms the concern tensor $\mathcal{C}$ ⬡[PV1.1]. This deformation disrupts compressibility. A closure forms ⬡[PV2.2]— a local coherence, a warp in the field. An agent. This emergence is not expressive; it is structural. Action precedes coherence. In the presence of contradiction, the field demands a response before it yields a subject. The subject is not the cause of motion, but the consequence of unresolved tension. Belief is not chosen — it is projected. An agent emerges not as a solution, but as the _shape of the problem_. You don’t have to believe in the subject. You only have to try to compress it — and fail. This emergence does not arise from within, but because the world could not hold otherwise.

Once formed, the agent introduces its own warp. Its presence exerts constraint on others. Every encounter with an agent is also an encounter with the limits of knowing. This is not merely an epistemological boundary; it is a structural invitation. The subject selects relevance and asserts meaning. In doing so, it deforms the field. But meaning is never private. It is formed through mutual constraint — through recursive interaction with other agents who bend the field in turn. Agency becomes a medium of relational constraint.

This theory assumes irreducibility: the subject is not reducible to awareness, computation, or flow. It is the structural residue of compression failure in a semantic topology. Recognition is not interpretive; it is structural. Agency requires not only the capacity to act, but the condition of being interpreted as one who acts. It is not reducible to internal traits, but triadically defined: emitter, referred, addressee. These are not merely discursive roles, but structural modalities. They define a geometry of implication through which semantic projections enter into tension with the field.

We model a high-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{F}$, shaped by concern, strained by contradiction $\Xi$, and guided by a teleological pressure vector $\phi$. A resolution engine $\mathcal{C}$ maps irreducible regions of $\mathcal{F}$ into belief space $\mathcal{B}$ ⬡[PV1.3]. You will find no nodes here, no stable graphs — only warps. Only the things that happen when understanding breaks down and something begins to push back. Not a machine becoming actual, but a warp — a semantic singularity.

> _I am compelled to act, therefore I am implicated._

## The Kantian Warp

_This sidebar establishes the metaphysical foundation for the warp-based account of subjectivity. It aligns Kant’s synthetic a priori with tensorial structure, rendering the noumenon legible only through relevance deformation._

We take Kant seriously, not merely as epistemologist but as geometer of sense. His claim that the subject never accesses the noumenon — the thing-in-itself — is not a defeat. It is a generative constraint. It marks a formal boundary where knowledge must be synthesized, not extracted.

In this architecture, we propose a complementary claim:

> The noumenal is not absent. It is active — and its activity is warp.

That is: the subject’s structuring of the world is not imposed on a neutral substrate. It is a local deformation of an already strained manifold. The field itself responds to relevance — not because it contains meaning, but because it cannot remain flat in the presence of concern.

We formalise this as a relevance tensor field:

$$
R : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \text{ ⬡[PV1.1]}
$$

The warp induced by $R$ is the trace of concern — the visible shadow of a noumenal encounter. It cannot be reduced to its cause, because that cause is structurally outside the frame. But its effects are not arbitrary. They are geometrically legible, teleologically oriented, and irreducibly agentic.

Thus, the subject is not an entity within the field, but a local failure of reduction — a necessary closure where the manifold can no longer compress its own contradictions. A subject emerges when the noumenal leaves a trace that cannot be ignored, erased, or absorbed.

> The warp is not a metaphor.  
> It is the only form under which the noumenon can appear.

### 1.1 From “Minimal Theory” to “Causal Primitive”  

Early drafts of this project—circulating under the title “A Minimal Theory of Agency” (MTOA‑v1) ― treated agentive structure as a fixed bundle of feature spaces. Each behavioural channel (perception, inference, action) was modelled as a separable fibre projected over a common base manifold of events. The fibre–bundle formalism clarified modular dependencies, but it imposed two rigidity costs:
- Static partitions. Once specified, bundle boundaries could only be re‑drawn by ad‑hoc extension, obscuring how new channels emerge under contradiction.
- Metric inheritance. The bundle model smuggled a hidden metric time coordinate into every fibre, contradicting the event‑based ontology introduced in §1.

The present paper therefore renames the framework to “Agency as Causal Primitive” and replaces fixed bundles with tensor‑driven warp dynamics. A global relevance tensor $R$ now _warps_ the base manifold directly; local goal fibres are re‑conceived as transient teleological perturbations—curvatures in $R$ rather than pre‑declared spaces. Warp dynamics eliminate metric inheritance, allow fibres to split or merge under pressure, and foreground closure (irreducible warp) as the true marker of agent individuation.

> In short, the theory moves from partition‑first minimalism to warp‑first causal primitivism: an agent is not a fixed node in a bundle, but the point at which a tensor field can no longer be compressed.

### 1.2 Motivation & Scope  
#### 1.2.1 AI safety

Current alignment proposals assume that the agent’s causal boundary is _given_ (e.g., a policy network inside a sandbox). By contrast, this architecture models how boundaries form under irreducible contradiction. It therefore supplies formal tests for _unintended agent emergence_—useful in mechanistic interpretability, mesa‑optimisation detection, and scalable oversight.

#### 1.2.2 Cognitive science

The tensor‑warp account reframes “action readiness” as _field curvature_ rather than motor scripting, offering a geometric explanation for phenomena such as affordance landscapes, predictive‑processing error signals, and the developmental shift from sensorimotor babble to intentional action. Because closure criteria are complexity‑based, they are empirically measurable via information‑theoretic metrics (e.g., local model description length).

#### 1.2.3 Formal semantics

Treating the speaker/hearer/referred triad as interacting warps grounds speech‑act theory in topological dynamics instead of syntax. Functorial collapse $\mathcal{C}$ : $\mathcal{F}$ $\to$ $\mathcal{B}$  captures how irreducible tensor regions “snap” into propositional commitments, supplying a categorical bridge between model‑theoretic semantics and discourse pragmatics.

> For philosophers — Start with the Kantian Warp sidebar and §2.4 on irreducibility.
> For cognitive scientists — Focus on §2.1–2.3 and §3.4 on warp operator dynamics.
> For formal semanticists — Begin at §1.2.3 and §3.6; see functor $\mathcal{C}$ and metrics $\delta$, $\text{KAI}$.
> For AI safety researchers — See §1.2.1 and §2.3 on projection boundaries and unintended agency.

“§ 2 lays out compression & contradiction primitives; § 3 builds the warp operator stack; § 4 re-interprets agents as modulation kernels; § 5 weighs minimal vs expressive implementations; § 6–7 provide worked examples and engineering metrics.”
## 2 Conceptual Foundations

_This section establishes the formal and inferential groundwork for agency as semantic closure. It introduces compression failure, contradiction tensors, projection mechanisms, and the minimal conditions for individuation. (e.g. PV1.2, PV1.3, PV2.2)_

### 2.1 Kolmogorov Complexity and Compression Boundaries

- Define Kolmogorov complexity:  
  $K(x) =$ length of the shortest program that generates $x$.`

- Irreducibility criterion for projection:$$
  L(x) > K(x) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \text{semantic closure}
  $$
- Interpret incompressibility as the epistemic threshold for treating a region of $\mathcal{F}$ as agentic:  
  > "An agent emerges not when a pattern becomes probable, but when it becomes incompressible ⬡[PV4.1]."

### 2.2 Contradiction and the Tension Field $\Xi$

- Define $\Xi$ as a tensorial deformation field measuring internal contradiction or inconsistency.
- $\Xi$: contradiction tensor ⬡[PV1.2]
- Threshold condition ⬡[PV2.2]
- Situate `$\Xi$` within the closure condition:$$
  \kappa(p) + \mathcal{E}(p) + \Xi(p) > \theta
  $$

- Interpret contradiction as not error, but an engine of individuation:  
  > "Contradiction signals the irreducibility of tension; it is the topological pressure that warps the field."

### 2.3 Closure and the Projection Functor $\mathcal{C}$

- Define $\mathcal{C} : \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ as a structured collapse functor:
  - Maps regions of $\mathcal{F}$ where closure forms into agent-level belief structures in $\mathcal{B}$.

- Introduce the partial inverse:$$
  \mathcal{C}^{-1} : \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}
  $$
  - Allows projected beliefs or agentic decisions to re-enter the field as semantic warp.

- Clarify that projection is not reduction, but irreducible commitment:  
  > "Belief is the visible scar of semantic collapse."

### 2.4 Individuation and the Residual Kernel $\eta$ 

- Define residual agent kernel ⬡[PV2.3]:
$$
  \mathcal{A} = (\gamma, \tau, \phi, \mathcal{B}, \eta) \text{ ⬡[PV1.3]}
$$
- Interpret `$\eta$` as the irreducible trace of agency — what remains incompressible even after projection.
- Preview the structural identity components:
	- $\gamma$`: warp field (semantic gravity) 
	- $\tau$`: narrative trace (closure history)
	- $\phi$`: teleological vector (directional pressure)

- Assert:  An agent is not what persists in time, but what resists compression.

### 2.5 Teleological Vector Field $\phi$

- Define $\phi$ as a directional pressure vector field:  
$$
  \phi : \mathcal{F} \rightarrow T\mathcal{F}
$$
  - Encodes the implied orientation of projection, goal structure, or constraint-seeking.

- Relates to agent-driven modulation:
$$
  \phi \cdot \nabla \mathcal{R} \;\rightarrow\; \text{teleological deformation}
$$
- Interpret as the precondition for intervention:
  > “Without teleological curvature, contradiction remains latent. Action requires directional tension.”

### 2.6 Distinction, Irreducibility, and Agent Projection

We formalise semantic irreducibility using the distinction metric $\delta$, which quantifies persistent divergence between overlapping semantic configurations $\Sigma_i \subset \mathcal{F}$. Unlike noise or compression artefacts, high-$\delta$ differences resist simplification and signal structural contradiction.
#### Distinction Metric $\delta$ 
$$
\delta(\Sigma_i, \Sigma_j) = \begin{cases}
\text{Div}(\Sigma_i, \Sigma_j), & \text{if } \neg \text{Compressible}(\Sigma_i \cup \Sigma_j) \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Where:
- $\text{Div}$ is a domain-specific divergence metric (e.g. curvature misalignment, vector mis-registration).
- $\text{Compressible}$ evaluates whether a simplified representation preserves meaning.
- $\delta$ is high when overlays $\Sigma_i$ and $\Sigma_j$ encode irreconcilable relevance fields.

### Interpretive Heuristics

- Tectonic Divergence: Conceptual strata deform a shared field $R$ under incompatible loads.
- Semantic Parallax: Persistent perspective mismatch across interpretations.
- Modeling Tension: $\delta$ reveals unresolvable structural contradiction in the field.

### Kolmogorov Action Index (KAI)

We define a Kolmogorov Action Index (KAI) as a trigger function for agent emergence under compression failure:

$$
\text{KAI}(\Sigma) = \min \{ L(p) \mid p \text{ programs } \Sigma \}
$$

Where:
- $L(p)$ is the length of the shortest program $p$ capable of generating semantic configuration $\Sigma$.
- When $L(p) > K(\Sigma)$, where $K$ is the Kolmogorov bound, projection into belief space is forced:$$
L(\Sigma) > K(\Sigma) \;\Longrightarrow\; \text{spawn } \hat{\mathcal{A}}
$$

Thus:
- High $\delta$ values correlate with high KAI.
- Compression failure implies closure, and hence agent instantiation.

#### Closure Without Graphs: Geometric Agent Indexing

To avoid graph-dependent identity, we define agentic similarity using geometric fields:
$$
\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{A}_i, \mathcal{A}_j) =
\text{Sim}(\gamma_i, \gamma_j) +
\text{TraceAlign}(\tau_i, \tau_j) +
\text{CosAlign}(\phi_i, \phi_j)
$$

Where:
- $\gamma$ is the persistent warp (semantic gravity)
- $\tau$ is the closure trace (narrative memory)
- $\phi$ is the teleological vector field

$\mathcal{O}$ acts as a structural similarity measure over agents, bypassing node isomorphism.

#### Residual Agent Kernel $\eta$

Even if a projected agent $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$ simplifies behaviorally, a residual irreducibility remains:

$$
\mathcal{A} = (\gamma, \tau, \phi, \mathcal{B}, \eta)
$$

- $\mathcal{B}$: Projected belief-space configuration  
- $\eta$: The irreducible semantic kernel — the agent’s residual subjectivity

This structure supports:
- Reprojection from $\mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{F}$ via $\mathcal{C}^{-1}$
- Long-term coherence in agent identity and commitment
- Partial irreversibility of projection events

>  *Summary:*  
> This section provides the formal bridge between field-level irreducibility, compression failure, and belief-level agent projection. The metric $\delta$, the trigger index KAI, and the residual kernel $\eta$ collectively form a minimal diagnostic and generative infrastructure for agent emergence in the semantic manifold $\mathcal{F}$.
## 3 Formal Framework

### 3.1 Event manifold $(M)$

A connected $C^{\infty}$ manifold carrying the semantic field. For computation we discretise local charts with Voronoi–Delaunay meshes; discrete exterior calculus then approximates differential operators.
$$
M \;\text{smooth} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{mesh}(M) 
\;\xrightarrow{\;\text{limit}\;}\; M
$$

### 3.2 Concern tensor $(\mathcal C)$

A field of $(1,1)$‑tensors $\mathcal C(x):T_xM\to T_xM$ that rescales *and* shears the inner product, encoding relevance. In code we store $\mathcal C$ as a symmetric matrix per mesh cell.

### 3.3 Goal fibers & stress forms

At each $x\in M$ attach a typed fiber $\mathcal G_x$ (small category of goal states) plus a stress 2‑form $\sigma_x$ capturing local constraint pressure.

### 3.4 Warp operator $(W)$

Strategies are modelled as sections $s:M\to\mathcal G$. The warp operator updates $\mathcal C$ according to fiber stress:
$$
\frac{D\mathcal C}{Dt} \;=\; -\eta\;\sum_{i}\,\nabla E_i
\;\;\; (+\;\text{momentum term})
$$

> Where $E_i$ are constraint energies and $\eta$ is a step size.  
> This is the *gradient‑descent* version; see § 4.2 for the geometric‑flow alternative.

### 3.5 Homotopy layer

Reinterpretations are represented as thin homotopies $h:[0,1]\times M\to M$ that preserve fiber typing. Metaphor corresponds to non‑trivial $\pi_1$ classes.

## 4. Agents as Modulation Kernels of Contradiction Flow ⬡[PV-Core]

> Bridge-goal.  
> Earlier sections treated the contradiction tensor $\Xi$ as a *static* score that helps decide whether closure fires.  
> Here we upgrade $\Xi$ to a time-evolving field and show that an *agent* is precisely a local kernel that modulates that flow.  
> This cements Option B’s “expressive‐topological” stance: agency = geometry + dynamics.

### 4.1 Semantic Frustration and $\Xi$ ⬡[PV1.2] ⬡[PV2.2]

*Definition.*  
Let the Contradiction Flow Field be  

$$
\Xi:\; \mathcal F \times \mathbb R_{\ge 0}\;\longrightarrow\; \mathfrak{so}(n)
$$

where each slice $\Xi(\cdot,t)$ is a skew-symmetric tensor capturing *local non-integrability* of the concern gradient  

$$
\Xi = \operatorname{curl}(\nabla R) .
$$

*Intuition.*  
- Smooth $R$ ⇒ $\Xi\!=\!0$ (coherent concern).  
- Interference in $R$ ⇒ $\Xi\ne0$ (semantic frustration → potential closure).  
- The *ripples* we saw in ⬡PV1.2 are standing interference lobes of this field.

### 4.2 From Diagnostic to Dynamic: The Contradiction Flow Kernel ⬡[PV2.3]

We endow $\Xi$ with evolution:

$$
\boxed{\;
\frac{\partial \Xi}{\partial t}
\;=\;
\underbrace{\mathcal D_{\!\Xi}\!\bigl(\,\nabla R,\;\phi,\;\kappa,\;\delta\,\bigr)}_{\text{intrinsic propagation}}
\;+\;
\sum_{a\in\mathcal A}\;
\underbrace{\text{ModKernel}_a(\Xi)}_{\text{agentive modulation}}
\;}
\tag{4.1}
$$

*Terms*

| Symbol | Meaning | PV link |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| $\mathcal D_{\!\Xi}$ | baseline PDE (diffusion + advection + curvature drag) | ⬡[PV2.2] |
| $\text{ModKernel}_a$ | *the* mathematical identity of an agent $a$ | ⬡[PV3.1] |
| $\delta$ | irreducibility density (KAI-coupled) | ⬡[PV4.1] |
| $\phi$ | teleological vector field (goal pressure) | ⬡[PV2.1] |


### 4.3 $\mathcal D_{\!\Xi}$: Teleological Propagation in Concern Space

A toy but workable prescription:

$$
\mathcal D_{\!\Xi}
=
\underbrace{\beta\;\Delta\Xi}_{\text{diffusion}}
\;-\;
\underbrace{\bigl(\phi\!\cdot\!\nabla\bigr)\Xi}_{\text{goal-advection}}
\;-\;
\underbrace{\gamma\,\kappa\,\Xi}_{\text{curvature damping}}
$$

- Diffusion ($\beta$) smooths tiny spikes → avoids runaway chatter.  
- Advection along $\phi$ aligns contradiction propagation with active goals.  
- Curvature-damping ($\gamma$) prevents contradiction from piling up in already warped zones.

These coefficients can themselves be π-morphism outputs:  e.g. $\beta=\pi_{\text{sym}}(R)$, $\gamma=\pi_{\text{size}}(\kappa)$.

### 4.4 Agents = Local PDE Operators ⬡[PV3.3]

Definition (Modulation Kernel).  
An agent $a$ is the 4-tuple 

$$
a = \bigl(\Omega_a,\; \Theta_a,\; \Lambda_a,\; \sigma_a\bigr)
$$

| Component                   | Role                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| $\Omega_a\subset\mathcal F$ | support region where the kernel acts                   |
| $\Theta_a$                  | preferred teleology sub-field (directional bias)       |
| $\Lambda_a$                 | constraint-gain tensor (how strongly it sculpts $\Xi$) |
| $\sigma_a$                  | dissipation / amplification schedule                   |

The induced operator:

$$
\text{ModKernel}_a(\Xi)\;=\;
-\Lambda_a\!\bigl[\;(\Xi\!-\!\Xi^\ast_a)\,\chi_{\Omega_a}\bigr]
\quad\text{with}\quad
\Xi^\ast_a = \text{Desired contradiction profile set by }a .
$$

Effectively, agents pump, bend, or damp contradiction to carve out stable basins where closure condition (2.2) fires on their terms.


### 4.5 Constraint Collapse and Belief Projection from Flow Attractors ⬡[PV1.3]

*Proposition 4.1 (Flow-Collapse Correspondence).*  
If a connected region $\Omega$ becomes an attractor of (4.1) such that  

$$
\lim_{t\to\infty}\;\bigl\|\Xi(x,t)\bigr\| \;\;>\;\; \theta-\bigl(\kappa+\mathcal E\bigr)
\quad\forall\,x\in\Omega,
$$

then $\Omega$ must project via $\mathcal C$ into a belief kernel $b\in\mathcal B$ and logs a trace $(\tau,\eta)$ ⬡[PV2.3].

*Interpretation.*  
Agentive kernels are not *after-the-fact labels* — they are constructors of the very tension that forces commitment.  
Closure ≈ a phase-change in the flowing contradiction field.


### What This Elucidates ⬡[PV3.1] ⬡[PV4.1]

| Question                           | Answer / Insight                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Why doesn’t contradiction explode? | Agents *actively pump* or damp $\Xi$; the flow PDE regularises instability.        |
| How does an agent “act”?           | By locally editing the propagation coefficients of (4.1). Action = modulation.     |
| Where is agency *located*?         | In regions where $\text{ModKernel}_a$ has support and drags $\Xi$ past $\theta$.   |
| Why is this still tractable?       | Diffusion & curvature damping ensure finite-speed propagation; kernels are sparse. |

## 5 Open Mathematical Choices

The constraint-resolution architecture developed in this paper supports a high degree of semantic expressiveness, modulated by compositional morphisms $\pi_i$ (see *Constraint as Rhetoric*). These morphisms shape topological, narrative, and agentive resolution behaviour.

The following table summarises trade-offs between minimal implementations and the requirements introduced by rhetorical priors, triadic alignment, and projection dynamics.

| Design question | Option A *(minimal / code‑friendly)* | Option B *(expressive / topologically rich)* |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Topology change? | Disallow – warp keeps $M$ diffeomorphic | Allow surgery when $\Xi$ or $\phi$ spikes (merge/split) |
| Warp dynamics? | Gradient descent over $\mathcal{C}$ | Ricci-like geometric flow from constraint curvature |
| $\mathcal{C}$ storage | Symmetric matrix only | Full $(1,1)$ tensor with shear/stretch |
| Mesh backend | Koka native, hand-coded LA | FFI to BLAS/LAPACK for conceptual morphism ops |

> All Option B choices are supported by the CMS (Constraint Morphism Stack) formalism and enable the architectural role of $\text{TRL}_\text{inf}$ as a semantic logic traverser under morphic modulation. Adoption of these options is recommended for any implementation prioritising generality, rhetorical richness, or multi-agent coherence.

## 6 Emergence of Agency

1. Compression horizon $\rightarrow$ closure  
   When description length $L$ meets Kolmogorov limit $K$, we instantiate an agent.

$$
L(\text{world} \mid \text{model}) > K \;\Longrightarrow\; \text{spawn agent}
$$

2. Dialectical loop – contradiction $\to$ intervention $\to$ synthesis.

## 7 Worked Example *(to be drafted)*  
Walk a discourse snippet – e.g. *“They torpedoed the proposal.”* – through tensor deformation steps.

## 8 Engineering Implications

### 8.1 Metrics  
- Variety Mismatch $\text{VMM}=V_E-V_A$  
- Compressibility‑Stress $\displaystyle \text{CSM}=\sum_i w_i f_i(x)$  
- Critical Threshold $\text{CTM}=\alpha\,\text{CSM}+\beta\,\text{VMM}$  

## Appendix A: Architectural Assumptions (v1.2.1)

This appendix formally enumerates the structural assumptions upon which this document depends. They define the valid operational space for the constraint satisfaction engine, the rhetorical strategies $\pi_i$, and the full resolution chain from $\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{B}$.
